#+TITLE: Logging Overview

Hi. I obsessively log stuff.

I have a @!(ref "logs")!@ page for all my logs.

Logs are also tied to @!(ref "tasks")!@.

One task
I did involved making an @!(ref "singer_demo"
"initial singing synthesis demo using WASM, webaudio, and rust")!@.
The task name is called @!(taskref "initial-singing-web")!@.

This logging format is new and still in flux. I wrote
it specifically for my time at RC. The source code for everything
can be found on [[https://github.com/PaulBatchelor/Recurse][GitHub]].

@!(ref "how_logging_works" "Back")!@.
