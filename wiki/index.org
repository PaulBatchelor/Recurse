#+TITLE: Paul's Recurse Personal Wiki

Hello. Welcome to my Recurse Center Personal Wiki!

My batch is over. See my @!(ref "retrospective")!@.

My name is Paul (he/him). I like to make computers sing!
During my batch (Summer 1 2024),
I'll be exploring ways to get vocal synthesis working
in the web browswer.

Here are some things to check out:

@!(ref "demos")!@: various web demos I made during my
batch.

@!(ref "logs")!@: daily journals I make during
the day that allow me to remember what I did.

@!(ref "dz" "DAGzet")!@: a @!(wikiref "zettelkasten")!@ inspired
knowledge database I have invented that allows me to structure things
as a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph][Directed Acyclic Graph]]
(DAG) using a markup language. The output has been HTMLized
for your viewing pleasure.

@!(ref "taskgroups" "tasks")!@: various tasks I am working on, organized
by group. It's also possible to @!(ref "tasks"
"see all the open tasks in one page")!@.
