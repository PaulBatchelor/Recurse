Hello. Welcome to my Recurse Center Personal Wiki!

@!(ref "dz" "DAGzet")!@: a @!(wikiref "zettelkasten")!@ inspired
knowledge database I have invented that allows me to structure things
as a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph][Directed Acyclic Graph]]
(DAG) using a markup language. The output has been HTMLized
for your viewing pleasure.
