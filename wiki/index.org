#+TITLE: Paul's Recurse Personal Wiki

Hello. Welcome to my Recurse Center Personal Wiki!

I will be using this a place to organize myself.

The @!(ref "logs")!@ are a daily journals I make during
the day that allow me to remember what I did.

The @!(ref "dz" "DAGzet")!@, short for "DAG-@!(wikiref "zettelkasten")!@" is a sort of
local knowledge tree I have invented that allows me to structure things
as
a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph][Directed Acyclic Graph]].
