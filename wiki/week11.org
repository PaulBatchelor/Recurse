More Trio work.

I sketched out a new way to think about chord
changes ("committing chords") that should make
the chords more coherent.

I did an initial attempt to port stuff to the web.
Got side-tracked. Attempted to use Typescript with p5.
It didn't go well. I'm going to start from scratch
(again).
