#+TITLE: Logging Pipeline
* General Overview
@!(img "/res/recurse/logging_pipeline.png")!@

Logs are written in a simple markup format in a text editor
(Vim).

Then, that text file is parsed and turned into an
intermediate format (SQLite is used here).

Finally, that intermediate format is parsed (SQL queries)
and turned into HTML output (using WeeWiki and Janet).

Logs, tasks, and taskgroups are written using the Descript
markup format, which get turned into SQLite.

Once in SQLite, they can be read with the WeeWiki
personal wiki static site generator via the Janet
Scripting language.
