#+TITLE: Demos
A collection of web demos. TBD.

@!(pagelink "/demos/vocal_chords" "Vocal Chords")!@: Experiments
in making singing vocal ensembles. The key thing I was
exploring was getting this voices to blend. This took a
fair bit of tweaking and fine-tuning!

@!(pagelink "/demos/poke" "Poke")!@: Poke a little fella around.

@!(pagelink "/demos/singer_test" "singer test")!@: An initial
demo, exposing the core vocal synthesis algorithm parameters
as sliders.

@!(pagelink "/demos/gesture_demo" "Tom's Diner With Gesture Synthesis")!@: An
interactive experiment featuring Gesture synthesis, an
algorithm I developed to help me control vocal synthesis
parameters in a continuous way to produce lyrical sounding
performances.
