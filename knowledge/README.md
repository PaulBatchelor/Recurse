# Knowledge
This is where I attempt to organize knowledge and resources
I acquire during my time at RC. The format I use is a
text-based markup I created called DAGZet. It is used
to create a directed-acyclic-graph format, which can
be compiled into a SQLite table for further querying and
processing.
