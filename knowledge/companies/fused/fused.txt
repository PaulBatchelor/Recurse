@17:14 Shifting my focus towards the app builder

This is the thing that was mentioned to me, so I'm going
to focus on this.

Note: at the time of writing, it was in beta

@17:25 micropip used to reduce startup time
#! dz companies/fused/references/micropip 
#! dz companies/fused/docs/workbench/app_builder/overview 
#! dz companies/fused/docs/workbench/app_builder/overview/dependencies
From the reference: "You may also choose to install dependencies at runtime
to reduce start-up time. Use micropip to install packages
at runtime".
---
One thing that was mentioned explicitely was reducing
start-up time. So, I can infer from this that they are
probably referring to the initial warm-up time of python.
---
I suppose the trade-off is the app becomes more snappy
at start-up, but the extra load time is added when you
perform an operation? Is is overall faster, or has the
time been moved?

@17:43 Understanding streamlit-folium

My brain is currently trying to wrap my head around
many layers of abstraction in the python eco system.
---
The high level question is "what is streamlit-folium,
and how does it relate to fused?".
---
Fused wants you to build and rapidly prototype data
visualizations as apps.
---
To make webapps in python, a thing called streamlit is
used. Streamlit turns python functions into webapps via
pyodide and stlite (serverless UDF functions).
---
Folium is a python library that connects with a popular
JS library called leaflet. Leaflet is used to make mobile
friendly interactive maps. With folium, data manipulation
can happen with Python, and then presented using leaflet js.
---
Therefore, we can say that streamlit-folium is a specialized
utility for embedding map rendering in a webapp, if all
you want to do is write python code.
