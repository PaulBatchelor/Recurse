        <p>This demo aims to showcase the Gesture Synthesis Algorithm,
        which can be thought of as the "SVG for audio-rate line generators".</p>
       
        <p>
        After clicking begin, what will be heard is a vocal
        synthesizer performing a rendition of the riff from
        "Tom's Diner" by Suzanne Varga (notably one of the first songs
        ever to be encoded to the mp3 format). Moving the
        tempo slider will change the speed at which this
        vocal melody is performed.

        <p>
        Notice how the legato jumps between
        the notes will instantaneously stretch or squash relative to the tempo
        changes. This is a key characteristic of the Gesture
        Synthesis Algorithm. This is accomplished by using
        an audio-rate phasor signal as a clock source. The 
        Gesture Signal Generator controlling the pitch
        then takes this phasor signal and uses it to control
        timing between lines relative to the speed of the
        phasor using a phase-locked loop. When the tempo
        of the clock is changed, the gesture signal generator
        is able to adapt and respond to the changes within
        a few samples.
