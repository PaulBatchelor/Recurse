I'm trying to follow the framework again. Here are
my thoughts on it so far.
---
what are the state variables? how are we storing them?
state variables can be indice substrings of both strings.
the function dp(i, j) tells us: given substrings w1[0:i] and
w2[0:j], what are the minimum number of operations required
transform w1 to w2.
our first approach will be top-down, so these will parameters
to a function
---
what is the recurrence relation?
There are 3 operations to consider, plus 1 non-op (match)
Insert a character: (ac, abc) -> (a[b]c, abc)
1 point, i + 1, j + 1
Delete a character: (adbc, abc) -> (a[]bc, abc) and vice versa?
1 point i + 1, j, or i, j + 1
(delete seems to be the edge case)
Replace a character: (axc, abc) -> (a[b]c, abc)
1 point, i + 1, j + 1
---
dp(i, j) = min(insert, delete, remove) + dp(i - 1, j - 1)
         = min(dp(i + 1, j + 1), min(dp(i + 1, j), dp(i, j + 1))) + dp(i - 1, j - 1)
---
I don't like the forward/backward of this

@10:10 cool, re.split seems to be an easy way to split messages up #dz:python/docs/stdlib/re/split

@10:16 split up log messages in multiline output
Ah, this will require more work
