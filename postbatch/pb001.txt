@2024-08-16 Interrupting the Circle
Years ago, I helped a friend of mine with their
art installation. One of the things I helped out
with was assembling a wall of glass shards from
handblown orbs. The instructions given to me were:
create a circle of glue, interrupt the circle, and
place the shard.

Interrupt the circle. That was what she said. Where
did she come up with that? The phrase left an
impression on me, and I still think about it.
---
I think a large chunk of my adult life can be described
in terms of circle-building and circle-interrupting.
I show
up somewhere, build a small routine that I follow
religiously, then intentionally break that routine.
The circle I made during RC was satisfying to build,
its edges were perfectly round, the grooves etched
in deep. Now, that beautiful circle is ready for
interruption.

I've been trying to figure out how to continue
to log things after my batch, or even if I should
log things. I'm slowly transitioning to "job-hunt"
mode. Is it even worth talking about? I'm doing
very boring very tedious things, starting with
a leetcode speedrun.
---
I'm still logging time for long-term things, and
that still seems worthwhile.

@13:30 Read: An Algorithm For Passing Interviews. #read-algorithm-interviews #timelog:00:13:29
Summary: The "Algorithm": there are usually 8 different
kinds of things you can use to solve a given
technical problem: Hash Tables, Linked Lists,
Binary Trees, Depth First Search, Sorting, Dynamic
Programming, Recursion. By asking about the runtime and
seeing what the problem is asking for, things can usually
be reduced to about 2-3 options.

@13:48 Read section on Trees and Graphs #read-cracking-coding-interview #timelog:00:07:34
This was a pretty short overview. Going to need
to find more books/resources on the subject
of Trees and Graph traversal. Off to The Algorithm
Design Manual.
