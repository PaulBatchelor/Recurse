@2024-12-29 Second to last day in NYC for December
@10:28 Making my flashcards app more convenient to use #dz:python/docs/stdlib/concurrency/threading #dz:python/docs/stdlib/internet/http/server/SimpleHTTPRequestHandler #dz:python/docs/stdlib/exceptions/KeyboardInterrupt
I am learnig how to use the threading module in python,
and getting more familiar with the SimpleHTTPRequestHandler
class. The KeyboardInterrupt Exception trick was also
nice to know about, seems to cleanly close the server

@11:00 Light flash-carding #flashcards #timelog:00:10:00

@12:07 Looking at dynamic programming card #dz:leetcode/explore/dynamic_programming #timelog:01:03:06

@2024-12-31 happy new year

@2025-01-01 new years day
@09:53 More climbing stairs again #dz:leetcode/problems/746_min_cost_climbing_stairs #timelog:00:15:00
I needed to look at the solution. The recurrence relation
is still a bit fuzzy for me. I'm not grokking the optimal
substructure.

@10:15 Continued #dz:leetcode/problems/746_min_cost_climbing_stairs #timelog:00:04:40
Going for both top-down and bottoms up.

@10:22 Onto tribbonacci, top down, bottoms up #dz:leetcode/problems/1137_nth_tribonacci_number #timelog:00:17:55

@10:42 Delete and earn #dz:leetcode/problems/740_delete_and_earn #timelog:00:20:46
Hints and similar problems tells me it's like house robber,
so I want to do house robber again.

@11:08 House robber, again #dz:leetcode/problems/198_house_robber #timelog:00:08:24
I'm trying to grok the pattern. Trying to grok better.

@11:22 Back to delete and earn #dz:leetcode/problems/740_delete_and_earn #timelog:00:11:58

@11:35 looking at editorial #dz:leetcode/problems/740_delete_and_earn #timelog:00:28:38

@12:46 1770 was the case study #dz:leetcode/problems/1770_max_score_multiplication_operations
Implemented top down and bottoms up approach using the
the case study. Bottoms-up I messed up with some off-by-one
errors because I turned there awkward range functions into
reversed iterables using =reversed=.

@14:57 dynamic programming explore card #dz:leetcode/problems/1143_longest_common_subsequence #timelog:00:20:16
figured out top-down solution by myself.

@15:19 attempt to work out bottoms up solution #dz:leetcode/problems/1143_longest_common_subsequence #timelog:00:06:50

@15:19 dynamic programming explore card #dz:leetcode/problems/221_maximal_square #timelog:00:57:19

@16:25 looking at editorial #dz:leetcode/problems/221_maximal_square #timelog:00:11:46

@17:51 an attempt to do a top-down solution #dz:leetcode/problems/221_maximal_square #timelog:00:24:39
It would be nice to try and get a top-down version. There's
also a "better solution"

@18:03 close to top-down derivation #dz:leetcode/problems/221_maximal_square

@18:20 got it! #dz:leetcode/problems/221_maximal_square
The trick was returning 0. I'm also noticing that I need
to store the maximum globally with both. That could be a
pattern to think about for some "find the max" problems

@18:20 studying the "better" solution in the editorial #dz:leetcode/problems/221_maximal_square #timelog:00:04:46
Didn't really grok it, but it's basically a space optimized
bottoms-up solution.
