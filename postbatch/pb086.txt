@11:16 Hub settling, current thoughts
I'm wondering, does LC have any guides for greedy algorithms?
Does TADM have greedy algorithms? Any literature? It's sort
of a vague concept, even though I've done a problem or two.
Is it important?

#! dz leetcode/problems/1372_longest_zigzag_path

@11:25 today's intution
#! dz $
It's about finding paths. So this is a DFS traversal
problem.
---
It's about finding the longest path. So the answer involves
keeping track of the longest path found so far.
---
Paths can start and end anywhere (not just roots or leaves)
---
The novel thing in this problem is the "zig zag" traversal
pattern, which requires keeping track of direction.
---
So, build a DFS algorithm using recursion. Locally,
this function needs to keep track of direction, and
the current path size.

@11:35 groking the zigzag logic before I test it
#! dz $
I've written out the code for zig-zagging. I want
to work out how it works.
---
This is preorder DFS traversal: process the node,
then the children. Depending on the direction (was the
current node the left/right child of the parent), it will
determine how the children are traversed here.
---
For LEFT going RIGHT or
RIGHT going LEFT: this is a zig zag, so the path continues.
---
For LEFT going LEFT for RIGHT going RIGHT: The zigzag stops,
and a new path begins. So set the length to be 0.
---
We'll see how correct that is.

@11:39 Off by one in path, bug I got it right in the end.
#! dz $
I started the path length at 0, when it should have been 1

@11:41 The pattern of storing some value during traversal
#! dz leetcode/components/count
#! dz leetcode/components/path
#! dz leetcode/components/max
There seems to be a subset of problems that involve
doing some kind of DFS traversal, and getting an aggregate
scalar value from this, like a count, or a max, or a sum.
---
It's DFS because these are problems that involve tracing
paths from a tree.
---
The easiest approach to do DFS is using recursion. In
Python, you can define functions inside of functions
which is very convient, as it captures lexical scope.
I can essentially have something like a "maxcount" variable
as a global that all calls to the recursive function make.
---
DFS recursion always makes two calls to left/right children.
It's cleaner to break out of the function early if the
node is null. Any more recursive calls, and this might
be a problem (this was a problem with 437 the pathsum iii, where
my first approach involved doing two sets of child traversals)

#! dz leetcode/problems/1161_max_level_sum_binary_tree

@11:50 Today's intuition
#! dz $
"level sum" makes me think this is BFS.
---
Max sum, so keep track of max sum. BUT the problem
wants to return the level, not the max sum. So the level
will need to be kept track of in addition to the max.
---
They want the smallest level where the sum is max. What
that means is if there are two levels that share the max
sum, take the smallest. In BFS, traversal starts from
small to large, so only update levels if the max is greater.
---
Level starts at 1, not 0

@11:56 Plan of attack
#! dz $
BFS, so use a queue data structure. The queue should be
a tuple containing the current level, and the node.
(we can also do double queues as well, but nested stuff
is a bit wrinkly for my cognition, trying this out)
---
Pop nodes off the queue, and add children to the stack,
incrementing the level by 1.
---
Keep a running total of the current sum. When the queue
pops a node with a higher level (always higher), update
the maxsum and level.

@12:06 seems to be off by one, why?
#! dz $
Ah, I was setting the max level to be the recently
popped level, not the current level

@12:08 Oops, I have hit an edge case
#! dz $

@12:11 My code is not processing the last level
#! dz $
Okay, the fix was moving the point when to skip empty
nodes. I was skipping before checking for new levels,
and I should check for new levels before skipping. Levels
are always going to be in order using a queue, even if
the child node is empty. You just skip it before trying
to add to the sum.

@12:26 I'd like to revisit this one

@14:21 Today's intuition
#! dz leetcode/problems/134_gas_station
Geez. I remember having a hard time getting the word
problem right for this one.
---
Working out the working loop for example 1, you can
begin to see a pattern: at stop i, the cost is cost[i]
and the gas is gas[(i + 1) % N], of which the difference
is the gas you get and the cost, so gas[(i + 1) % N] - cost[i],
or cost[i] + gas[(i + 1) % N].
---
When you work these differences out, you see that the only
correct solution happens to be the only positive value.
---
Going to take a look at the one with no possible answer now

@14:40 I'm pretty stumped, editorial time
#! dz $
I can't understand how this was supposed to be a single-pass
problem.

@14:42 editorial notes
Net change from going from station i to i + 1: gas[i] - cost[i]
---
Let gain[i] = gas[i] - cost[i], where gain[i] is the net
change in amount of gas in our tank from moving from i to
i + 1.
---
If tank goes below zero, the route cannot be finished.
---
There can only be one valid solution, which is key
to solving this problem

@15:07 There is a lot of explanation for such a small amount of code

I feel like I need to revisit this later.
