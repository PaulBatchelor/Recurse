@09:06 Some links curation #timelog:00:17:08

@09:24 Migrating some C links to their own subgraph #timelog:00:16:21

@09:47 gah these missing links will be the death of me. tooling up #timelog:00:20:23
tools/find_missing_nodes.sh created. it works well enough

@10:41 This is actually vol 2, I have found vol 1 #read-system-design-interview
I think I will have this task for both volumes.
I can then add timelogs to specific volumes

@10:43 Try to work out multiple timelogs per tag #timelog:00:04:27
This might actually work already

@10:49 Migrate system design interview to vol2 branch #timelog:00:15:00
