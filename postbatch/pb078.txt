@09:06 Some links curation #timelog:00:17:08

@09:24 Migrating some C links to their own subgraph #timelog:00:16:21

@09:47 gah these missing links will be the death of me. tooling up #timelog:00:20:23
tools/find_missing_nodes.sh created. it works well enough

@10:41 This is actually vol 2, I have found vol 1 #read-system-design-interview
I think I will have this task for both volumes.
I can then add timelogs to specific volumes

@10:43 Try to work out multiple timelogs per tag #timelog:00:04:27
This might actually work already

@10:49 Migrate system design interview to vol2 branch #timelog:00:15:00

@11:07 Try to make better dzfiles importer #dzfiles-importer #timelog:01:47:19

@11:48 Re-remembering subprocess in python #dzfiles-importer
#! dz pythondocs/stdlib/concurrency/subprocess/run
Going to make the importer in python

@11:48 bytes.decode() needed to convert to string from stdout in subprocess #dzfiles-importer
#! dz python/docs/stdlib/concurrency/subprocess/run
#! dz python/docs/stdtype/bytes/decode

@12:01 considering optparse for a clear flag #dzfiles-importer
#! dz python/docs/stdlib/cmdline/optparse
For now, I think I will just clear by default.

@12:10 drop-in replacement seems to work? now, I want something with directories #dzfiles-importer
When a directory is found instead of a dz file, read the
file from the dzfiles directory.

@13:06 lots of path troubleshooting. #dzfiles-importer
#! dz python/docs/stdlib/os_services/os/path
#! dz python/docs/stdlib/os_services/os/path/dirname
#! dz python/docs/stdlib/os_services/os/path/abspath
#! dz python/docs/stdlib/os_services/os/path/isdir
#! dz python/docs/stdlib/os_services/os/getcwd
I ended up with a logic that validates and makes sure
the file for a path exists. If it can't find it the first
time, it attempts to use a generated prefix.
The initial results seem to work out.

@13:25 Import initial TOC for vol 1 #read-system-design-interview #timelog:00:07:30
Only got to first three.

@13:32 These first three chapters are what I was missing
#! dz system_design_interview/1/toc
