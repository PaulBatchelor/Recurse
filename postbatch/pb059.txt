@12:30 Futex term mentioned #dz:systems/futex
I thought I had a node for that.

@13:10 Planning #timelog:00:45:00
At the time of writing, I've logged about 150 hours of
leetcode prep. I've documented 125 problems, with 68
of those being documented in my dagzet (see: @!(dzref
"leetcode/problems")!@).
---
Systems design is still new. I started things at the
beginning of the month, reading both DDIA and the systems
design interview book, with the idea of using my dagzet
to make connections between the two of them and reinforce
what I'm learning. At the time of writing, I've logged
3.5 hours into DDIA, and 6.5 hours into the system design
interview. So 10 hours.
---
Leetcode is feeling close. I'm reviewing LC75 problems,
and it would be nice to revisit some Grind75 problems
as well. I'd like about 20-50 hours more time here before
I feel confident, or as much as I can do before the new
year.
---
Systems Design, at the clip and depth I am currently going
at, needs about 30-40 more hours. This could easily be
more, but my current goal is to be reasonably high level.
---
A chunk of my time has been spent studying more frontend web
architecture. I've put 16.5 hours into reading NextJS
material, and almost 12 hours into reading the typescript
handbook. It still feels very far removed from my core
set of skills, but I feel more empowered to jump into
things.
---
My current velocity aims to be about 4 hours of work
a day. I usually can't spend more than 2 hours on any
one single task.
---
To feel really ready: I seem to want a total of 50-100
hours more study. If I commit and put in the time, that's
about 2-3 weeks minimum. Which is about the time between
now and January.
