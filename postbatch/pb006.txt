@19:27 Back to this IT parser? #itparser-rust
Do I still remember any Rust? I've got leetcode brainrot.
---
I never really finished this one. So, now I'm going to
put some more effort into this one.

@19:30 So many magic constants. yay. #itparser-rust

@19:32 we are going to do it right now. #itparser-rust
going to load things into a struct, create incremental
unit tests. Maybe just one test is all that is needed
right now.

@19:56 Well, now I am taking some steps back. #itparser-rust
Looking into burntsushi regex library in order to figure
out how *they* set up tests.

@20:08 Ugh. What a rabbit hole #itparser-rust
I feel like I temporarily avoided this problem before.
Now, I'm going to address it slightly more head-on.

@21:03 More cargo fighting #itparser-rust

@21:07 We got a test working in main. good enough #itparser-rust
