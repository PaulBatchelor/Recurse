@10:30 Late start. Updating my website a little bit.
@11:04 Thinking about flashcards... #flashcard-mvp #timelog:00:15:00
There's a lot of information I need to ingest, and I am
starting to think having a system in place is going to
be necessary.
---
I already have a data format figured out. It's built into my dagzet
system. I'll need to get it working with the rust implementation,
but that shouldn't take too long.
---
What I don't have figured out is a spaced repetition system.
Something that allows me to go through a set flashcards and update
their frequency depending on how I answer.
---
I imagine most of the heavy lifting will be done with SQLite.
A small CLI (prototype in python?) could be used to present
a set of (up to) N flashcards from a given set of namespaces,
randomly selected from a weighted distribution based on priority.
