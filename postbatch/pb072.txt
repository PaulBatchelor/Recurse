@08:20 edit distance #LC75-review #timelog:00:30:00
@08:50 Morning attempt #dz:leetcode/problems/72_edit_distance
Got some broken code. I don't think I have the intuition yet.
I vaguely remember this problem from the algorithms book.
I was scared of it then. I am scared of it now. I'm trying
to follow the framework outlined in the dynamic programming
explore card. I identified the variables (index position),
and am now trying to implement the top-down version. It's
not going well.

@09:12 Counting bits #LC75-review

@09:22 Brute force works #dz:leetcode/problems/338_counting_bits #timelog:00:43:35

@09:39 Close to giving up on the O(n) solution #dz:leetcode/problems/338_counting_bits
My intuition so far: check the LSB. If it's a 0, you are only
flipping one bit, so it's the previous 1 count plus 1.
If it is a 1, then more bits get flipped. I have an inkling
that you can do something with the previous zero LSB number.

@09:48 got linear time working #dz:leetcode/problems/338_counting_bits
I had the right line of thinking, I just needed to put more
care into the code: the previous number vs the previous
number of bits. If the previous number has a 1 LSB,
it's not a simple +1 like if it were a 0 LSB. The LSB
for the number flip to 0, so somehow I realized that
you could look at the shared bits between the last 0 LSB
(prev - 1), and then add 1 to that. I don't know, I wish
I could explain this better. I wrote out the binary bits
and looked for patterns.

@10:22 Another attempt at coin change. #dz:leetcode/problems/322_coin_change #timelog:00:39:05

@11:02 I don't think I'm handling edge cases correctly. #dz:leetcode/problems/322_coin_change
I'm currently trying to implement a top-down solution.
I think I have the variables correct, and I have established
a recurrence relation I believe is correct. However, I'm
running into issues with actually getting edge cases set up.

@12:22 Test comment node #nn:dagzet/comment_node
The tag above =nn:dagzet/comment_node= should create
a uniquely node named "dagzet/comment_node" and then
have it be linked to this particular timestamp

@20:39 Trying to integrate comments #nn:dagzet/comment_node_2
Can we connect these nodes
