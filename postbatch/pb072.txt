Got some broken code. I don't think I have the intuition yet.
I vaguely remember this problem from the algorithms book.
I was scared of it then. I am scared of it now. I'm trying
to follow the framework outlined in the dynamic programming
explore card. I identified the variables (index position),
and am now trying to implement the top-down version. It's
not going well.
