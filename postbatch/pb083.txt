@14:37 Attempt to isolate this weird template bug, maybe fix it #timelog:00:40:00
Bug is fixed. Off by one error. IDs in dagzet are 1-indexed,
not 0-indexed.

@15:19 Back to mapping backtracking (now recursion 2) #timelog:00:14:38

@15:35 binary tree outlining #timelog:00:03:41
#! dz leetcode/explore/binary_tree 

@15:40 hack in some multiline support #dzbrowse-dzfiles-linebreak #timelog:00:08:22
I added an explicit =+/.= syntax. It looks kinda goofy,
and a little verbose compared to "\" that you
typically see, but It's very clear. Plus, it only
took me 8 minutes to make.

@2025-01-18 A small window of hub time
I'm going to use this time to: outline more of my ed reading.
