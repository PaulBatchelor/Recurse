@17:51 I am looking up the editorial #timelog:00:15:53

@18:02 debugging: why isn't word squares showing up #timelog:00:25:07
#! dz python/docs/stdtypes/str/rstrip
Did some print debugging, it looks like the key has
a space at the end of it. going to try rstrip()-ing
things.

@18:18 debugging: this problem actually is a dagzet issue
#! dz rust/std/str/trim
dagzet is adding the space. confirmed by querying the
SQLite database.

The answer is to use trim().
