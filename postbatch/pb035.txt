Ah. I was not making a Trie in my original implementation.
I only kept track of possible combinations for each
position, which was more efficience memory-wise, but
it did not keep track of paths between unique words.
---
Example: "dig" and "dog" show up as (d (o (g)) (i (g)))
There are two g's here. My structure represented the set
as ([d], [o i], [g]).
---
If I were to add "mop" to the the structure.
A trie would look like:
===
((m (o (p))
 (d (o (g)) (i (g))))
===
My structure would look like:
===
([m d] [o i] [g p])
===
There's no way to tell if "mip" is a valid path or not
---
Even with pointers, "mog" could be valid with this path.
===
([m:[o] d:[o i]] [o:[g p] i:[g]] [g p])
