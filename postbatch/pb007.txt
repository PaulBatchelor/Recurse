@16:51 Grind75 has literature to go with it. reading some of that.
Link [[https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook]].

Dagezt ref: @!(dzref "prep/tech_interview_handbook")!@.
---
Found @!(dzref "prep/frontend_interview_handbook")!@ as well.

@17:02 I've done a fair bit of LC questions from LC75, strategize next steps
I don't know how much time I'm going to give myself. I do feel
a bit more confident about the leetcode stuff.
---
Not that I'm a bit more settled, I'm trying to get the
hours in. It's tough being in a new place and settling.
---
I think what I need to do is be particular about which
problems I work on, and why. Will follow up on this at
some point.

@17:04 Reading bits of the frontend interview handbook
I think I'm going to be going into more fullstack jobs,
so this seems like something to read. I am going to read
the table of contents and try ot get a sense for how long
this book actually is.

@17:09 Frontend Interview Handbook thoughts
There's a lot I don't know, but these feel like attainable
unknowns.

@17:22 Going to just manually write some notes on jobs

@17:38 Walrus operator? Walrus Operator.
See: @!(dzref "python/walrus_operator")!@.

@18:02 Well, the numbers are in.
I went to the jobs search page, filtered by "new york city",
and hand typed the tags for all the jobs that showed up.
I then wrote a python program to parse the data and give
me count aggregates. JavaScript and TypeScript tied with
21 instances. The runner-up was react, followed by python.
---

@18:11 The high-level conclusions.
flexibility on employability is
going to involve a fair bit of front-end experience. My guess
is that this is due to a number of these being startups that
need a shiny looking product.
---
I think I need to pursue frontend. Learning typescript
is a safe bet. Learning javascript is a safe bet. React
is still a reasonable enough thing to be learning.
---
I think my full-stack learning path is going to be top-down.
Starting with making pretty things in the browser, then
gradually getting those pretty things hooked up to
backend things. It's the most distant from my skillset
right now.

@18:21 The plan
Resources to look into first: @!(dzref "prep/frontend_mentor")!@
as well as @!(dzref "prep/frontend_interview_handbook")!@.
I want to get comfortable enough building conventional industry
standard things.
---
I'm trying to see the forest from the trees. What exactly
are we doing here? I don't need to "learn to code". I've
been doing that. I need to learn to think differently about
software. In my work, I touch computers differently than
how web developers touch computers.
So yes, I'm learning "tools" instead of "code"
right now, but only to the point that I can understand
how people approach computers.
---
Frontend UI stuff seems to have a language and grammar to it.
They are the building blocks that go into building what we see
as a "product" for "users". Tools in this ecosystem are ultimately
built in the name of a commercial "product". Learning how to
go along the grain of these tools will help be better form
project ideas that are distinct as well as educational.
---
For example: A software synthesizer, in many ways, goes
against the grain of a typical web app. It has a interactive
visual vocabulary that was developed independently of the web.
When you try to build a synth for the web the way you
build a VST, you get something that feels out of place.
My Trio demo feels out of place. It was built based on
my experience designing for tablets and mobile phones. The
only "webby" thing it has going for is that it has a URL.
The rest of it blindly copies conventions from a different
medium.
---
I have my qualms about web audio, but sound design and
music composition are areas of distinction for me. I should
probably use some of those chops for another web-based
project. This next web project needs to go with the grain
of the web zeitgest. It'll have a "frontend", not just
a canvas. It will feel like a "product". It could have
"users". There will be sound, yes. But that sound will
be driven by some kind of data.
