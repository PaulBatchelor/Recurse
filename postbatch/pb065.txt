@10:45 Grokking intuition for initial filling of queues #dz:leetcode/problems/2462_total_cost_hire_k_workers
I've been struggling with a bit of logic here in the
editorial solution. It has to do with how to initially
fill up the two queues.
This is the thing that was tripping me up. There are two
queues to pop from: the head and the tail.
---
The head fills up the first =candidates=, but the tail
uses =max(candidates, len(costs) - candidates)=. This is
used to prevent overlap, but my brain is having a hard time
being convinced of this.
---
Most of the time, the starting position of the tail will
be =len(costs) - candidates)=. The end position of
the head will *always* be at the
position =candidates - 1=. To prevent overlap, the start
of the tail needs to be at least at index =candidates=,
so if =len(costs) - candidates= is smaller than that,
go with candidates.

I feel so dyslexic with binary search.
