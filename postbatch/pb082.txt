@2025-01-14 Ridgewood visit, Hub, etc
@11:34 Back to hub from ridgewood, settling in

@11:36 finish up chapter 1 #read-system-design-interview #timelog:00:41:37

@11:49 Some sort of wildcard path would be nice? #read-system-design-interview #dagzet-wildcard-path
As I'm taking notes, I'm finding a bottleneck tends to be
getting the right double dots working. So, "../../../../foo"
instead of "../../../foo". it would be nice to have a
search built in, like "../?foo/bar" could mean "find the
first occurance of the pattern "foo bar" in another path.

@12:19 Chapter 2
