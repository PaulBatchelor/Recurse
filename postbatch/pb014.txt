@12:58 Damn. I guess today I will get some stuff done.
The moment I woke up, this day was going wrong. I was
really looking forward to just letting the entire day
derail. Yet, here I am at the library.

Per the recommendation of several people, I am going to
just the Leetcode website to write code. It has the
verification and eveything, and will help me pick up
on weird edge cases.
