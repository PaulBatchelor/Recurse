@10:54 Fix my timelog utility
it's not doing HH:MM:SS properly, the hours are rolling
over.

@16:44 Task curation

@16:45 Future of this? #itparser-rust
It's kind of ad-hoc right now, and I don't have a defined
purpose for this at the moment. Getting into schismtracker
would be cool, and this could be a way to work with that
data. But to what end?

@16:47 this was crap #read-js-trivia
I'm sorry. I can only read so much bad writing. This had
knowledge, but it was presented in a really unthoughtful
way. I appreciated the references, but most of them were
blog posts soft-summarizing the better official references.
I'm just done with that.

@16:48 Too unbounded of a task #frontend-mentor
And it's too design-y for me. I'd rather have a task be
more defined like, "okay we want to get a look and feel
like this app".

Looking at things like tailwind ui components @(dzref "webdev/tailwindui")!@ and Radix @!(dzref "webdev/radix_ui")!@ are more of a targeted
thing.
