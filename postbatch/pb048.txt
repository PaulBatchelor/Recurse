@2024-11-28 Happy Thanksgiving.
@09:06 Get subgraphs that are also nodes to be included in nodelist #timelog:00:43:05
Solution: the node lookup table needed to add a check before
being passed into the JSON generator (genpage.lua)

@09:59 The nodes are showing up now, but, the external children are not #timelog:00:15:40
That was a treesorter problem

@10:15 Make the names less verbose in HTML output
Needed for better looking TOCs making heavy use of paths
