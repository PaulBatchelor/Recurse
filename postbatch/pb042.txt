@08:58 Introducing a new shorthand for cx in dagzet #timelog:00:16:29
cx tends to be pretty verbose, since paths
have to be full paths. I tend to be writing
a lot of =cx A B=, where 'B' is some node I am
connecting things to.

I propose that '^' indicate the string of the last item
connected to for left/right position, respectively. That
is, assuming I can't get '$' to work the way I want to.
