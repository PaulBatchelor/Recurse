@09:06 some links reading #timelog:00:38:18

@18:52 dynamic programming explore card #dz:leetcode/problems/1335_minimum_difficulty_job_schedule #timelog:00:24:00
I'm still grokking 1335. The problem, and the solution. Even
with both spelled out for me in the dynamic programming
explore card, it's still difficult.

@20:27 Coin Change #dz:leetcode/problems/322_coin_change #timelog:00:58:48

@21:17 Trying to get the recurrence relation #dz:leetcode/problems/322_coin_change
I think the state variables are the starting
coin, and the amount to add up to. I could probably code
something up and sort of get it, but I'd like to be able to
notate this in a more mathematical way that shows I actually
grok this problem.

@21:44 Recurrence relation looks right, code is wrong #dz:leetcode/problems/322_coin_change
Giving up for tonight
