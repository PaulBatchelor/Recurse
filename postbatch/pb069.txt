@10:15 714 Best time to buy/sell stock with transaction fee #LC75-review #timelog:01:04:34

@11:20 714 initial review #LC75-review #timelog:00:11:14

@11:22 How far I got with my own intution #dz:leetcode/problems/714_best_time_buy_sell_stock_transaction_free
I knew it was a 2d dynamic programming problem because it
told me on LC75. I did not write any code. I spent most
of my time trying to get the table right.

You can go bottoms-up to find the max profit. Start
by looking between two days. It will either be 0 or
the difference between the two days (minus the fee) if
it's positive. From there you can build up, gradually
adding days.
---
The thing that's tripping me up is how you start
accumulating buy/sell pairs. I'm missing that logic
in my table.

@11:33 I need a small break from this problem I can't read the editorial #dz:leetcode/problems/714_best_time_buy_sell_stock_transaction_free
will return later today?

@21:49 attempted. did not finish #dz:leetcode/problems/137_single_number_2 #timelog:00:13:10
I did peak at the answer, but I'm too tired to grok it.
