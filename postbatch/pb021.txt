@15:00 Break
@16:05 Tailwind components browsing
@17:01 Found some NextJS tutorials/guides
I've seen this keyword flash up way more times than
tailwind, though the tailwind ui components do look
nice. Might be worth segmenting my time into.
@17:16 NextJS and Vite seem to be very common
Seems like it's an either/or thing? Whatever, going to
dip my toes into both.

Current job I'm looking at has NextJS/React/Typescript
combo.
@17:26 I have once again found myself on LinkedIn
I think I need to get off my computer now.
