@12:16 This is kind of garbage #frontend-mentor
I've been trying to, in good faith, read through the the
"javascript trivia" section. I wanted to make flashcards
because it felt like a rote memorization. But like,
most of the time, the questions aren't focused enough,
and answers meander a little bit.
---
The nice thing about these questions is that there are
references and resources. Most of these are stack overflow
and blog posts, and while I've been saving some of these
to read, I'm kind of done with the casual long-winded
almost correct answers that come from blog posts.

@12:19 Flashcards added to rust DZ parser #flashcard-mvp
I was trying to make some flashcards to test, and I realized
making well-scoped and well organized flashcards from what
I've been reading takes more work than making the MVP
program that displays them. So, pausing on this until I
figure that out more.

This just turned into more neovim troubleshooting. Sigh.

@12:38 I'm back in the neovim config hell #read-typescript-handbook
I want to get tsserver working in my neovim setup on my
box now.

@12:50 neovim needs updating #read-typescript-handbook
I consolidated everything into one git repo, and it works
on 2/3 machines. My box has nvim 0.9, everywhere else
0.10. I'm guessing that is the issue.

@14:46 Trying to build nvim 0.10 apk from source
@15:26 A good enough nvim config hack was made
APKBUILD route wouldn't work due to incorrect versions
in deps. So I just wrote a little hack. Tooltips in
the typescript LSP do not seem to work on my box.

@15:29 Back to typescript. #read-typescript-handbook #timelog:00:28:41
