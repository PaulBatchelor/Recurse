@08:47 334: increasing triplet subsequence #leetcoding #timelog:00:45:10
I glanced at this one I think. I don't think I ever
actually tested it.
---
Well, I didn't understand this problem when I first read it.
A subsequence doesn't have to be consecutive. Before I looked
at the answer, I tried making it a sliding window problem,
and it failed the edge cases.

@09:37 692: top K frequent words #grind75 #timelog:00:31:54
Lexicographic order threw me off. It turns out the built-in
structures in Python used to solve this
problem (Counter, heapify) seem to handle this for you
already? Was I supposed to know that?

Follow-up problem 347 Top K frequent elements. Apparently
this follows a similar pattern:

@14:36 LC347: top k frequent elements #leetcoding #timelog:00:17:32
This is a variation of top K frequent words

@14:57 LC53: Maximum Subarray #grind75 #timelog:00:25:16
I did this already I think. But I didn't submit it, so
it's a redo now.
---
Note to self: a subarray is different from a subsequence.
Subarrays are continguous.
---
Wow, I did not get this right the first time. I gave up
early and looked at the answer.

@15:30 I have to redo the first 3 weeks #grind75
I didn't submit. So, I didn't really learn anything. yay.

@15:31 LC57: Insert Interval #grind75 #timelog:01:18:50
Got something working, but I want to review this tomorrow
