Once again, I find myself here in Brooklyn at the hub.
Which is interesting only because I don't live here anymore.
I've had an extended week trip to NYC from Boston. It's
lovely to be back.

@13:45 Setting up. Thinking about what to work on

@13:53 Lunch

@15:01 Pushing changes to website

@15:05 Flashcards #flashcard-mvp #timelog:01:06:17

@15:23 Some lingering design questions #flashcard-mvp
How and when to make sure new cards get imported?
This is important because there can be situations where
there are just enough cards in the metadata to fill
the cache which ends up making the same cards being
re-used over and over again.
---
When to recycle cards from level 5 back to level 1?
---

@15:49 Trying to get the loading logic right #flashcard-mvp
My thinking is new cards should be loaded into
the system automatically.
---
My current bucket system is flawed because it only
kicks on when the cache is too small. I should
have a pre-load before the caches are filled that
update the database.
---
It's possible that flashcards can go missing if
I delete a node. So far, this databse has been mostly
append-only.

@16:32 Break? What to do next?

@16:40 Lost and Safe
