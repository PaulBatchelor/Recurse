@08:28 Getting my dagzet stuff working with link curation. #dz:python/docs/stdlib/cli #dz:python/docs/stdlib/runtime/sys/argv
All I want to do at the moment is get an argument into
my program ala argc/argv in C. The CLI stuff is a bit
overkill, but nice to know it's included. sys.argv is what
I wanted.

@09:32 1143 longest common subsequence #timelog:00:33:28 #LC75-review

@10:20 1143 study #LC75-review #timelog:00:32:06

@10:34 studying approach 3 #dz:leetcode/problems/1143_longest_common_subsequence/solutions/03_dynamic_programming
This one is closest to how I was trying to think about
the problem. It'd be nice to examine the other solutions
at some point, but diminishing returns.

@10:43 I was pretty close #dz:leetcode/problems/1143_longest_common_subsequence/solutions/03_dynamic_programming
The key difference was that they populated the table
in reverse. To the point where I want to revisit my
unreversed approach

@10:60 I was actually VERY close #dz:leetcode/problems/1143_longest_common_subsequence/solutions/03_dynamic_programming
The crucial thing I missed was how to handle
the matches. I didn't grok the diagonal movement
along the table. If I had fixed on line of code, it
would have worked
