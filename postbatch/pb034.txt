211: Design and Search Words Data Structure.
I think it's a Trie problem. Spent most of this time
just getting the Trie structure the way I imagined it. Have not
implemented the search yet, which I believe will be a DFS
using a stack (for backtracking when a '.' is encountered).
@12:56 211 continued #grind75 #timelog:01:12:21
Ran out of time. Right data struture (trie), but my
search doesn't work properly ('..' is a problem on the
huge edge case).

@14:23 wait wait, one idea to try. #grind75 #timelog:00:28:15
I'm breaking out too early.

Nevermind. I'm not getting it right. Time to stop.

@16:38 Re-examine priority tasks #timelog:00:01:48

@16:39 Completed? #flashcard-mvp
I mean, it's got a bug, but it works.

@16:41 Typescript Handbook #read-typescript-handbook #timelog:00:24:07
Finally done with the reading.

@18:40 database internals #reading-dbint #timelog:00:18:08
Ordering, operations, invocatoin/completion, shared memory,
registers, safe/atomic/regular, consistency models

@21:12 databse internals #reading-db-int #timelog:00:13:18
consistency models, single-operation, strict consistency
(theoretical), all possible histories vs histories
permissable under X, linearizablility, total ordering of
events
