@09:21 33: Search in Rotated Sorted Array (cont.) #grind75 #timelog:01:01:31
Another swing and a miss. Turns out I don't even
grok vanilla binary search terribly well. I got a lot of
things to pass, but I kept running into edge cases. Details,
or maybe patches to things I don't fully get.

Giving up on trying to get this right. I've put in about 2.5 hours
of struggle, where I developed some insights. Looking at the
answer now.

I was farther off than I thought, but I managed to code
something up reading the instructions for approach 1.

Binary search isn't sticking with me. I feel little bit
of my left/right dyslexia with these problems. There's just
a bit of a cognitive gap. It just felt like I was missing
small details that needed to be flipped.

@12:57 At this point, I've officially solved all the mediums in my grind75 "no-easy" list
My next goal here will be to do all the easy problems now.
There are 24 such problems.
