@11:56 Getting warmed up
My laptop ran out of batteries, which was weird. I really
thought I powered this off. I guess that didn't happen.
Oops.

@11:58 Troubleshooting this weird variable width issue on leetcode #timelog:00:12:35

@12:12 Another shot at thinking about edit distance #LC75-review #timelog:01:04:53

@12:18 Reading Skiena #dz:leetcode/problems/72_edit_distance
He has this as a case study

@12:42 Banged out a top-down solution #dz:leetcode/problems/72_edit_distance
I had to use the Skiena code for reference

@13:10 Bottoms-up solution is a WIP. will need to return later to it. #dz:leetcode/problems/72_edit_distance #dz:leetcode/problems/72_edit_distance/solutions/bottoms_up
I'm trying to mechanically copy it over from the top-down
solution that works. I think I am missing something in the
initialization step. I've worked too long on it today, and
need to move forward.
