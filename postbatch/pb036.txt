@08:53 Finishing up LC417 #grind75 #timelog:00:41:32
I'm hoping I just need to code up an edge case and
that my overall solution is solid.

@09:06 LC417: They wanted you to use BFS or DFS, not dynamic programming #grind75
My edge case isn't working.

@09:14 I just bought a year of premium. #grind75
If I do 6 months, it'll be cheaper than the monthly rate.

@09:36 Onto LC19 #grind75 #timelog:00:28:14
Remove Nth node from linked list

@10:35 Examinining what's left of grind75 #timelog:00:18:40
I've been just tackling medium problems, and it looks
like I'm wrapping up. We have 3 mediums left. Looks like
I might be able to get them done by the end of the week.
