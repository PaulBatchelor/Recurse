I just want to get a sense for how large this project is,
and also do some re-ordering with the new dzfiles system

@12:09 Arrived at the hub. Trying to query logs by node with wildcard #timelog:00:13:59
I want to do this in order to check on what nodes I was
looking at last.

See: tools/nodelogs.sh

@12:36 revisiting problem as DFS #timelog:00:47:46
#! dz leetcode/problems/425_word_squares 

@12:50 today's intuition
#! dz $
Still doing this as a DFS backtracking problem, where
one enumerates a candidate combination, validates, and
breaks early for combos that don't work.
---
A word square can be represented as either a set of
rows or a set of columns. A valid word square must work
such that row[i]=col[i] for every i from 0 to N, where N
is the size of the square (1-4).
---
Partial candidate solutions are in represented as
rows.
---
To validate the partial candidate, iterate through
each row. Ensure that the prefix col[i][0:nrows]
matches row[i]. If not return false.

@13:14 works on solution, but TLE on submission
#! dz $
Attempting to memoize with functools

@13:27 I believe my DFS is correct, but too slow, time for Trie?
#! dz $

@13:43 Working out a possible Trie solution #timelog:01:24:23
#! dz $
Create Trie Structure from all the words
---
For each word in word list, append all valid
solutions where first row is word.
---
Use the Trie to enumerate possibilities

@13:56 You can gradually build word squares from prefixes
#! dz $
For example [ball area lead lady] can be built up
incrementally: [b], [ba ar], [bal are lea], [ball area lead lady].
---
The fact that it's prefixy makes me think I'm
in the right direction. Trie traversal is still fuzzy.

@14:25 Working through by hand Trie traversal
#! dz $
The base example doesn't have multiple possibilities
for words down the Trie, so I'm extending these
examples to do that. So, in the example word list
[area lead wall lady ball], I'm adding "acae" and
"lada" in order to get another valid word square 
[ball acae lada lead] to go with [ball area lead lady]

@14:55 I need a break from this
#! dz $
I am now trying to move way from drawing the square
visually as I go, and just using the Trie I drew to
work out the logic. It's taking some time for things
to stick. I'm going to switch to other things now.
