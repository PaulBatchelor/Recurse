@2024-06-16 Day 28. Chord progressions in vocal ensemble, studying VCV Potential code
55 days left of Batch.
---
Prev: Added adjustable vocal tract size to singer demo
(crude, but it works), establish internal time logging
protocol for my logging system, created a
linear gesture demo, some sound design work on
"vocal chords" demo.

Next:

|| @!(taskref "react-describing-ui")!@: read more from the
"describing the UI" chapter from React website.

|| @!(taskref "vcv-potential-study")!@: study the VCV potential
plugin code.

@14:08 starting this log

@14:12 Follow-up: add interpolation for smoother size transitions #voxbox-size-control #voxbox-better-size-control

@14:15 This would be a good opportunity to use my code annotation tool #vcv-potential-study

@14:17 Pulling in codegen utilities #vcv-potential-study

@14:20 Pulling in code files to study #vcv-potential-study
It doesn't have to be all the files, just enough to understand
how the plugin architecture is organized. Figuring
that out now.

@14:28 I have once again installed NERDTree to help me out #vcv-potential-study
I stripped my editor of all features a while ago, now they are
slowly creeping back in.

@14:46 Gotta make file ranges visisble in HTML output #vcv-potential-study
Eventually, I'd like to generate interactive pages of code,
but that can wait.

@15:09 Okay let's get studying #vcv-potential-study #timelog:01:01:44

@16:24 Trying to make dztodo filterable

@16:27 break

@16:43 Attempt to make a chord progression using gesture #chords-demo #timelog:01:45:00
