20 days left of batch.

Zulip checkins: I don't think this is working for me.
I tried out this silly daily haiku thing with
an end of the week digest,
and it didn't get the traction I wanted.
I feel like I'm adding unnecessary noise.
So, no more Zulip check-ins for a while.
I will continue to log here.

On a more personal note, Zulip is triggering some
of the anxiety-induced FOMO feelings similar
to the ones that prompted
me to delete Facebook a decade ago. Crazy to
think that even after all this time and growth,
I still find myself reacting to situations in
same way (how disappointing). Going to have to delete
Zulip from my phone after the batch is over.
