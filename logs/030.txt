53 Days Left of Batch.

prev: Initial chords demo code works in browser, needs
elaboration. Also, C Creatures. I didn't get to any of the
other things planned. But, I did have some nice
conversations. I guess I'm getting OSC interface working
to control VoxBox? Looked into a few Rust and C options.
Prototyping something out today.

---
next:

|| @!(taskref "voxbox-OSC")!@ work out initial OSC controlled
prototype of voxbox.

|| @!(taskref "chords-demo")!@ iterate. Functionally it should
all work for the most part. Now, I need to build it out
and add more chord buttons.

|| @!(taskref "htmlize-codestudy-files")!@: try to find
time tobegin work on htmlizing code study files.

|| @!(taskref "voxbox-tongue-interface")!@: This would
be good to have for the OSC controller

@08:03 Morning triage

@08:19 Current gameplan #voxbox-OSC
The rust library @!(dzref "rust/crates/cpal")!@ didn't work
on my alpine linux box, but @!(dzref "rust/crates/rosc")!@.
was fine. So, the plan is to build something up using
libsoundio, then have the inner loop be implemented in C.

@08:24 renaming "rust/libs" to "rust/crates"

@08:25 Getting ready to write zulip checkin
