@2024-06-18 Day 30. VoxBox over OSC, more Chords.
53 Days Left of Batch.
---
prev: Initial chords demo code works in browser, needs
elaboration. Also, C Creatures. I didn't get to any of the
other things planned. But, I did have some nice
conversations. I guess I'm getting OSC interface working
to control VoxBox? Looked into a few Rust and C options.
Prototyping something out today.

---
next:

|| @!(taskref "voxboxOSC")!@ work out initial OSC controlled
prototype of voxbox.

|| @!(taskref "chords-demo")!@ iterate. Functionally it should
all work for the most part. Now, I need to build it out
and add more chord buttons.

|| @!(taskref "htmlize-codestudy-files")!@: try to find
time tobegin work on htmlizing code study files.

|| @!(taskref "voxbox-tongue-interface")!@: This would
be good to have for the OSC controller

@08:03 Morning triage

@08:19 Current gameplan #voxboxOSC
The rust library @!(dzref "rust/crates/cpal")!@ didn't work
on my alpine linux box, but @!(dzref "rust/crates/rosc")!@.
was fine. So, the plan is to build something up using
libsoundio, then have the inner loop be implemented in C.

@08:24 renaming "rust/libs" to "rust/crates"

@08:25 Getting ready to write zulip checkin

@08:43 Zulip checkin posted

@08:57 setting up some boilerplate #voxboxOSC #timelog:00:19:32
Now we have some C code making sound, and some exported
rust code setting the frequency of a sine tone.

@09:17 splitting up C code a bit #voxboxOSC #timelog:00:16:34
This code is from the libsoundio sine example.
I need to make sure this is organized well enough
that I can start putting custom DSP code from Rust,
and eventually add OSC polling.
---
Okay, nevermind on the splitting. I have a better sense of
this control flow. I want to make sure I can get my Rust
data into C okay.
---
While I didn't do any refactoring, I did manage to figure
out how to send userdata to the SoundIO struct.

@09:34 Initial attempts to get a voice working #voxboxOSC #timelog:00:39:50

@10:16 Initial attempt at receiving OSC messages #voxboxOSC #timelog:00:17:13

@10:35 Now we try to get it to shut up over OSC #voxboxOSC #timelog:00:18:24

@11:01 Why are pitches sounding different on OSX and Linux? #voxboxOSC

@11:03 I explicitely hard coded a request for 44.1kHz on OSX and that seemed to fix it #voxboxOSC
