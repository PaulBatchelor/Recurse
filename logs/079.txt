@2024-08-06 Day 79. ALSA and CPAL troubleshooting.
3 days left of batch.
---
I'm feeling pretty raw today. I've been processing a lot
of feelings. You know how when you lose sensation in your
hand, and then the feeling comes back? Those initial pins
and needles hurt, but you know it's a sign
of progress and it'll pass. It's kind of like that.
Things just hurt, but it feels like progress. I
don't think I was feeling much before this.
