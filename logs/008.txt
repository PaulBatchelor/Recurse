Next: Setting up tasks. Phasor DSP code in boing^3. Start
transferring some code to new VoxBox project.

@07:47 Tea and Morning Triage

@07:53 create generate_all script

@08:19 Is this even actionable? #plan-reading-schedule

@08:34 back to task parsing, where was I here? #task-sqlite-gen

@08:38 Right, time for thinking about SQL schemas #task-sqlite-gen

@08:48 Also trying to make the text files they are in a kind of group #task-sqlite-gen

@09:06 get insert statements for tasks working #task-sqlite-gen

@09:10 hook up to rest of files #task-sqlite-gen

@09:15 Again with the string escaping in SQLite #task-sqlite-gen

@09:19 Quick walk outside

@09:48 Breakfast

@10:19 Begin work on tag parser #add-tag-parser
Going to need this if I want to connect logs to specific
tasks.

@10:39 Tag extraction works, now SQLite statements #add-tag-parser
Will need a new table for this. I also will want to reference
tasks specifically, so I need to make sure I can get the
right rowid from the logs row.

@10:44 Mostly safe to a assume day/time combo is unique #add-tag-parser
I don't have a formal constraint for this, but this is a 
reasonably safe assumption. I'll use this to look up the rowid.

@10:45 Actually, would max(rowid) work? #add-tag-parser
The tag parsing is always done immediately after
inserting the log entry to the table. I assume it auto-increments
and is the largest? This would be much easer.

@10:56 Let's see what works? #add-tag-parser
It works!

#+BEGIN_SRC sqlite
select tag, logs.title from logtags inner join logs on logs.rowid = logtags.logid;
#+END_SRC

@11:01 I wonder if org can be parsed in my logs?
