Cracked screen update: I have an appointment tomorrow
morning at the apple store. I was thinking about just
getting it in and fixed right there, but now I'm thinking
I'll just get a quote and sit on it some more. It's
going to be a lot of money. The internet tells me
it's somewhere in the ballpark of 600-700 USD.
I'm
starting to think about just getting a refurbished
thinkpad (x390). I'm not locked into the apple ecosystem,
and I don't really need a powerful laptop for my needs.
Also, my m1 works just fine when plugged into an external
monitor.

Prev: More VoxBoxOSC Work, playing around with Sourcehut's CSS
to figure out how they do line highlighting, reading on React,
published my vocal chords demo! [[https://pbat.ch/recurse/demos/vocal_chords]].
---
Next:

|| @!(taskref "voxbox-tongue-interface")!@: Implement
this because it would be nice to have for voxboxOSC.

|| @!(taskref "voxboxOSC")!@: add the rest of
the planned parameters (tongue control and gain).

|| @!(taskref "react-describing-ui")!@: Pretty sure I can
finish up reading this chapter today.

|| @!(taskref "htmlize-codestudy-files")!@: Get the
extracted CSS to go from almost working to working.

@08:28 Morning Triage.

@08:40 Zulip Check-in.

@08:57 Done with morning logging I think.

09:24 Off to get batteries for my scanner wand

@10:39 React reading #react-describing-ui #timelog:00:32:22

@11:30 Lunch

@12:46 Implement gain, add smoothing parameter abstraction #voxboxOSC #timelog:00:21:47

@13:08 Time to look at this tongue interface again. #voxbox-tongue-interface

@13:16 I think I might keep the diams vector in for now #voxbox-tongue-interface #create-diams-interface
It's very helpful for tongue control.

#13:27 Going to add smoothing to the tongue
