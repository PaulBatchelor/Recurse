implementing voice staggering.

@08:12 Morning Triage

@08:39 complete in theory. time to test in trio demo. #event-driven-gesture #demo-trio
Attempt voice staggering using event-driven gesture
algorithm, see what goes wrong.

@08:47 dagzet could bea good portfolio project #dagzet-rust
It's got a good scope, it's got data structures, and
I'm putting in the time to incrementally test as
I go.
---
This is also a migration project. If I do this right,
I should be able to drop in the dagzet program
and have it replace my adhoc lua code for my
knowledge tree generator, which I'm using
to power the knowledge graph here.

@08:53 This has been completed #rust-neovim-setup

@08:54 Not today, vscode. Not today #vscode-rust-setup
vscode does not work on Alpine, and NeoVim
works well for my needs.

@09:05 publishing

@09:08 Oh my god there's a clippy book
See @!(dzref "rust/clippy_book")!@.

@09:34 connection shortcuts #dagzet-rust #timelog:01:03:58

@09:39 oh no, I'm getting my task tags wrong #dagzet-rust

@09:42 back on track. #dagzet-rust

@10:00 Reminding myself why string hashmaps are used for nodes #dagzet-rust
hashmaps are used as the data structure to ensure
that a node isn't created twice.
---
if I wanted to get a node name from a string,
how would I do that? Right now, the answer seems
to be enumerate through all the keys and find
an answer. I could also just make a separate
inverse lookup table out of a vector.

@10:20 I made an inverse lookup table #dagzet-rust
It's a memory hit, and there's room for
the eventual possibility that the tables will go out
of sync. But, it's good enough for now. I imagine
I'll be doing this lookup operatoin quite a few times
I don't want to do a linear sweep every time.

@10:50 Up next: connection remarks #dagzet-rust
Variation on a theme, I suspect.
Unplugging and getting lunch now.

@12:35 Time to revisit the trio. #demo-trio #timelog:03:01:06
Now that I supposedly have an event-driven gesture,
I need to begin work incorporating those mechanics
into the existing demo.

@12:36 refamiliarizing myself with the work. #demo-trio

@13:00 light refactoring. main clock added. #demo-trio
Now, for the initial process of introducing these
eventful gestures.
---
Before any events can be added to any gestures, we need
to be able to simulate adding events. Events should
only be added after the lead has held onto a pitch
for one period.
---
The easiest way to do this using a global timer that
keeps track the phasor ticks, which occur once a second.
If a u32 is used, how many seconds is that?
---
Okay, so that's about a millenium short of 50k years.
I think there's no general risk of things overflowing. I
will be long dead and forgotten before that happens to
a potential user.
---
Is this enough granularity though if I want to detect
pitch changes? Maybe not actually.

@13:11 How to tell if pitch has lasted for a period. #demo-trio
Might need to ink this one out.

@13:27 Inked out an idea #demo-trio
First, implement things so that it detects changes in
pitch. Then, build a sample and hold with along with
a global monotonically increasing clock that increments
at the start of every tick.
---
Now, any time a pitch change occurs in the lead, it
can be compared against the sampled pitch. If the
pitch is different, but the timestamps aren't, the
whole period is marked as having been changed for
the rest of the period.
---
The "dirty bit" trick is used in situations where
the pitch changes quickly inside a period.

@13:32 Implementing pitch changes, alert on change. #demo-trio

@13:37 implementing clock and sample and hold #demo-trio

@13:50 shoot. I'm actually unable to articulate when a change *should* happen #demo-trio
I think there may be another state required.
---
How about this:
If there has been a requested
pitch change from the current lead pitch, and this request
has been held for a period, apply this changed pitch
to the current lead.
---
This should happen at the start of every period.

@14:05 well, now my logic isn't working at all. #demo-trio
I was setting things to be negative oops.

@14:11 this timing logic is trickier than I expected #demo-trio

@14:15 Going to try caching the lead value between takes. #demo-trio
Caching the lead value and also storing the last changed
value may be what I'm looking for.
---
Essentially, this lead value needs ot be updated regardeless,
but the other two voices need to be delayed.

@14:19 Okay, the complexity comes from the lead value needing to be updated #demo-trio
I can't simply cache the last lead pitch every time
because I'm setting it every time.

@14:23 The delayed behavior works as expected now. #demo-trio
Now I am looking to delay chord changes on the upper/lower
voices.

@14:28 I think I might be able to work staggering without gesture #demo-trio
I think I'm going to have to do this anyways because the event
scheduler in the eventful gesture is so small, and can really
only take one vertice at a time.

@14:34 reworking things for variable stagger times #demo-trio
The logic would need to be: lower gets set first, then
upper.
---
Initially I had it so that the chord would be determined,
and then you'd send off the events with delays. Rethinking
this a bit.
---
I want it so that the upper pitch only changes if it waits
2 beats, and the lower pitch changes if it waits 1 beat.

@14:48 I'm going to try having another state variable #demo-trio
I want to have a state when the lower changed, but the
upper hasn't. When the upper gets changed, the lower
changed gets setup.

@15:01 Now I want the voices to be staggered on too #demo-trio

@15:08 Weird timing bugs #demo-trio

@15:14 Try to reset clock on new voice. #demo-trio

@15:34 Clock works, but the voices aren't resetting pitches #demo-trio
This causes some very rude sounding glisses sometimes.

@15:45 it works. clocking out. #demo-trio

@16:00 Presentations.
I co-presented with Dan and Seamus on "bbl_vizzy".

@17:00 Dinner
First time at stickies. Would go again.

@19:00 Negation needed for NAND. (approximate time)
DF had a good pair of questions for me.
First one was "what is NAND?" "Not AND". Follow up:
"Why NAND? Why not AND?". I could not answer this
well, but luckily JK was there. I am paraphrasing,
but it turns out that the negation operation is
important for Turing completeness. You need the
negation to do things like turn a 1 to a 0.
---
Both NAND and NOR are what are known as "universal
gates", in that they can be building blocks to
implement the core boolean operations like AND, OR,
and NOT.

@19:32 Reading. #read-elem-compsys #timelog:01:01:16
