@08:12 Morning Triage

@08:39 complete in theory. time to test in trio demo. #event-driven-gesture #demo-trio
Attempt voice staggering using event-driven gesture
algorithm, see what goes wrong.

@08:47 dagzet could bea good portfolio project #dagzet-rust
It's got a good scope, it's got data structures, and
I'm putting in the time to incrementally test as
I go.
---
This is also a migration project. If I do this right,
I should be able to drop in the dagzet program
and have it replace my adhoc lua code for my
knowledge tree generator, which I'm using
to power the knowledge graph here.

@08:53 This has been completed #rust-neovim-setup

@08:54 Not today, vscode. Not today #vscode-rust-setup
vscode does not work on Alpine, and NeoVim
works well for my needs.

@09:05 publishing

@09:08 Oh my god there's a clippy book
See @!(dzref "rust/clippy_book")!@.
