@2024-08-09 Day 82.
last day of batch.

I am overwhelmed. I don't have all the words yet, but
I think I have a few. I think I might work on my reflection/retrospective.
I've been really into the writing style "I MISS LORINA BULWER",
so I think I might try to do something like that.
Something along the lines of "I RECURSER PAUL BATCHELOR".

Reflections: @!(ref "retrospective")!@.
@08:37 Morning Triage.

@08:38 Generate a page using basic HTML and a list #dagzet-ink
And then it'll be done.

@08:41 Sunsetting. I got far enough on this. #itparser-rust
It's a good proof of concept for a proof of concept. I can
return to it later, if I need it.

@08:44 re-reading lorina bulwer. #retrospective
See: @!(dzref "misc/i_miss_lorina_bulwer")!@.

On second thought. This might be a little too intense
for the RC crowd. But, I might give it a go anyways.

@08:53 Writing some things down. #retrospective #timelog:00:45:15
I might turn this into tamer prose we'll see.

@09:35 Publishing?
