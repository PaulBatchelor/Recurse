@2024-07-14 Day 56. Week 9. Linear Gesture Builder for mnolth
26 days left of batch.
---
Prev:

A sine tone signal /
writes itself to a buffer / 
after many hours
---
Next:

|| @!(taskref "add-day-titles")!@: First thing today.

|| @!(taskref "linear-gesture-interface")!@: build
some code that makes it easier to build out linear
gestures using mnolth

|| @!(taskref "dagzet-rust")!@: if there's time.

@09:06 Morning triage

@09:23 A couple notes on blip-buffer size #tic80-sine-tone
This is going to bother me if I don't write it down.
I made a mention that having a buffer size of (sr/10)
would effectively downsample the buffer by 10x, and
this is not true. It's not true because that buffer
is not filling in a second of audio, it's 1/60th of
a second of audio.
---
Let it be known that many incorrect assumptions and guesses
were made here. I leave them intact for historical reasons.

@09:33 Indulging myself a little bit here #linear-gesture-interface
I've got a linear gesture interface that works pretty
well in VoxBox, and I'd like to be able to use it
with mnolth. I also want to be able to populate gesture
from within lua. To do this, I'll need to build out
an interface in rust, export a C interface, and
write some mnolth glue code (mnodes).
---
mainly doing this so I can compose some of this audio
telephone thing using mnolth. Frankly, the Uxn
thing in GestVM is a bit cumbersome.... the setup
time takes too long.

@09:47 publishing

@09:50 Let's add some titles to my logs. #add-day-titles #timelog:00:38:08

@10:30 Clearly, I really do not want to do this. #LC75

@10:52 Initial linear gesture interface work #linear-gesture-interface
First, I'll build out the initial interface in Rust,
which will wrap the existing linear gesture node with
a self contained vector of paths. I'll then write
some C-style functions that make it possible to
do the following: initialize, append, tick, and destroy.
I will make a quick example of this in Rust, which
will be a good stopping point.
---
The next parts involve actually getting this inside
of mnolth/mnodes, and creating the glue code there.

@10:57 Initial scaffolding #linear-gesture-interface #timelog:00:26:58

@11:20 Creating an int to behavior wrapper #linear-gesture-interface #timelog:00:35:38
Using this as an opportunity to learn how
to build a function with proper error handling
and testing.
I was going to do a more elaborte check validating
each "okay" one, but it was less messy just to
see it catch errors.

@12:01 Build an initial example using interface. #linear-gesture-interface #timelog:01:16:06

@12:11 Running into borrow-checker woes #linear-gesture-interface

@12:18 More borrow-checker woes. I am thinking of this problem wrong #linear-gesture-interface
Instead of building on the existing LinearGesture Generator,
build a new gesture interface that owns a vector that
can grow.

@12:29 Things work now. That's enough for now. #linear-gesture-interface #timelog:00:27:52
Going to work on the C interface next.

@13:59 Attempting the C interface #linear-gesture-interface

@14:47 Using C interface with Rust example. #linear-gesture-interface
I think I can do that right?

@14:50 We cannot make this both a crate and a library, but can we? #linear-gesture-interface
I did a bit of a hack, which was to duplicate "src/lib.rs",
make it "src/clib.rs", and then add an example in the
Cargo toml file.

@15:14 Time to get this in mnodes. #linear-gesture-interface

@16:38 Sidetracked. This will have to wait. #linear-gesture-interface

@18:44 Back on this... #linear-gesture-interface #timelog:00:53:38
Most of the day has been wasted away. Going to try to
move quickly on this.

@19:40 Proof of concept done. Good enough for tonight? #linear-gesture-interface
Gotta compose now.
