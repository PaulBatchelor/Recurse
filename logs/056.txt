some code that makes it easier to build out linear
gestures using mnolth

@09:06 Morning triage

@09:23 A couple notes on blip-buffer size #tic80-sine-tone
This is going to bother me if I don't write it down.
I made a mention that having a buffer size of (sr/10)
would effectively downsample the buffer by 10x, and
this is not true. It's not true because that buffer
is not filling in a second of audio, it's 1/60th of
a second of audio.
---
Let it be known that many incorrect assumptions and guesses
were made here. I leave them intact for historical reasons.

@09:33 Indulging myself a little bit here #linear-gesture-interface
I've got a linear gesture interface that works pretty
well in VoxBox, and I'd like to be able to use it
with mnolth. I also want to be able to populate gesture
from within lua. To do this, I'll need to build out
an interface in rust, export a C interface, and
write some mnolth glue code (mnodes).
---
mainly doing this so I can compose some of this audio
telephone thing using mnolth. Frankly, the Uxn
thing in GestVM is a bit cumbersome.... the setup
time takes too long.

@09:47 publishing

@09:50 Let's add some titles to my logs. #add-day-titles #timelog:00:38:08

@10:30 Clearly, I really do not want to do this. #LC75
