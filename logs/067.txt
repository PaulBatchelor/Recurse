more facial expressions in poke, port balloon
signal generator to trio?

@08:43 Morning triage

@08:53 Might be worth trying to port balloon #voxbox-balloon
I have just created the task for it.

@08:56 Might be a good day to do some resume follow-up stuff #resume-follow-up
I got some good suggestions.

@10:02 finished up responding back to jobs chat.

@10:03 publishing.

@10:06 laughing facial expressions in poke. #poke-laughter-chitter #timelog:01:05:39

@12:54 Trio Chord Selector planning #demo-trio-chords #timelog:01:11:47

@14:41 Plan out some initial code #demo-trio-chords #timelog:01:16:26
The initial structures: chords, and valid chord
transitions.

@15:53 Initial chord structure, now to think about querying #demo-trio
We want to make a query: given some pitch (0-11), and
a current chord, provide a range of potential candidates
for the next chord.

Since this is going to be used in a realtime
situation. My thinking is to populate
with a pre-allocated fixed size array that is managed
internally.
