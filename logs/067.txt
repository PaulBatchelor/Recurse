15 days left of batch.
---
Prev: initial dagzet rust port completed.
---
Next: work out chord engine logic in trio. add
more facial expressions in poke, port balloon
signal generator to trio?

@08:43 Morning triage

@08:53 Might be worth trying to port balloon #voxbox-balloon
I have just created the task for it.

@08:56 Might be a good day to do some resume follow-up stuff #resume-follow-up
I got some good suggestions.

@10:02 finished up responding back to jobs chat.

@10:03 publishing.

@10:06 laughing facial expressions in poke. #poke-laughter-chitter #timelog:01:05:39

@12:54 Trio Chord Selector planning #demo-trio-chords #timelog:01:11:47

@14:41 Plan out some initial code #demo-trio-chords #timelog:01:16:26
The initial structures: chords, and valid chord
transitions.

@15:53 Initial chord structure, now to think about querying #demo-trio
We want to make a query: given some pitch (0-11), and
a current chord, provide a range of potential candidates
for the next chord.
---
Since this is going to be used in a realtime
situation. My thinking is to populate
with a pre-allocated fixed size array that is managed
internally.

@16:00 Presentations

@19:27 Wrap-up chapter 4 (machine language), begin chapter 5 (Computer Architecture) #read-elem-compsys #timelog:01:00:09
