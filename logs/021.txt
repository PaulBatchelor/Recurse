@2024-06-09 Day 21. Even more NaN-hunting. Initial preset export. Synthesized overtone throat singing.

@10:32 Compare nose reflections with tract implementation. #implement-velum

@10:41 Left Reflection coefficient seems too high #implement-velum
In the rust version, I'm getting 2.0. In the original, it's -0.1.

@10:43 wait wait wait, I need to look at right reflection not left #implement-velum
Similar deal actually. The original is still a small negative value.

@10:46 Changed velum to 0.0 in reference, similar results #implement-velum
I have my velum set to be 0 in the rust version. So there is definitely
something wrong with these left/right reflection coefficient
calculations.

@10:52 Sum value is very different #implement-velum
It is larger in the reference (~7.3) vs my implementation
(1.062).
---
I had my nose starting position calculated using a
relative percentage of the tract length. Maybe this is
an unstable way to do this?

@10:59 I think I found it. #implement-velum
There were typos in my reflection calculations. Additions
that were supposed to be subtractions. Looking up the
wrong index.

@11:01 We have actual sound! #implement-velum

@11:02 Velum control seems to work! #implement-velum

@11:03 Reworking demo #implement-velum
I lost the ideal tube shape sound. Going to need
to fiddle around with the interactive example.

@11:24 Getting velum slider working: Unknown upcode (195) #implement-velum

@11:32 commented out panics and debug prints #implement-velum
I think this was getting in the way of wasm compilation.

@11:48 turning off vibrato #implement-velum

@12:50 Some initial throat singing shapes made #implement-velum
lots and lots of trial and error

@13:33 Smooth transitions between overtones #implement-velum
At this point, I'm just having fun. I think the velum is
correct haha

@14:06 Working on a melodic sequence #implement-velum

@14:15 Drown it in reverb #implement-velum

@14:42 Throat singing demo works, created mp3 for it. #implement-velum
Now, time for cleanup.

@14:57 well, it's a good thing I made an mp3... #implement-velum
My shapes for the throat singing example
are ruined once again because there was some code I
accidentally commented out.

@15:46 Another attempt #implement-velum

@16:09 probably good enough #implement-velum

@16:13 restoring web example, now with velum #implement-velum

@20:27 Coding up a quick exporter for singer demo #quick-preset-export
Textarea with a button that says export/import.
Export fills the textarea with the current vocal tract state.
Import loads the stuff from the textarea.

@20:40 Let's see if I can have one function update the pitch and UI releated to it #quick-preset-export
Probably not going to be an ideal design pattern.
I can already see why an architecture like react would be helpful.

@20:47 Nevermind, let's just try and dump data? #quick-preset-export

@21:15 Uploaded something with just "export", import still a WIP. #quick-preset-export
Good enough for tonight.
