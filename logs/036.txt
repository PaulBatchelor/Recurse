@2024-06-24 Day 36. Week 6.
47 Days Left of Batch.

This is now about at the halfway point. Going to have to start
thinking about what happens now.

Gandalf: "All we have to decide is what to do with the time that
is given to us."
---
I spent this last weekend brainstorming an interactive
experience involving my vocal synthesis engine. Next thing
you know, I'm shopping around for small cross-platform
game libraries that can handle pixel art okay. Sokol
so far has been the winner @!(dzref "gamedev/sokol/github")!@.
---
Working title for my little game: A Blob Named Bucket.
---
Next:

|| @!(taskref "htmlize-codestudy-files")!@: I ran into a bit
of a hitch yesterday, hoping to return to this.

|| @!(taskref "bucket-initial-scoping")!@: Set up some tasks
for this.

|| @!(taskref "voxbox-shape-morphing")!@: Begin planning
how to add shape morphing with linear gesture.

|| @!(taskref "what-now-week6")!@: Halfway point. Stop,
Reflect, Plan.

@08:15 Morning Triage.

@08:22 De-prioritizing. #voxbox-better-size-control
As I think I've mentioned already, this is turning out
to be more of a DSP problem, less of a programmer problem.
It'd be cool to have at some point, but not during my
time at RC.

@08:26 De-prioritizing #demo-tongue-control
I think I need more musical demos now.

@08:27 Initial investigation complete #investigate-2d-gameengine
Sokol and/or SDL is probably going to be my solution moving
forward. The general approach is to use textures and
rectangles for sprites. There is documentation on this
that I can read.

@08:30 It would be great to get this done this week #htmlize-codestudy-files
I think this is a very important aspect.

@08:33 This could still work as a self-contained demo #demo-poke
This could be done in a p5 app. I just want a circle that
giggles and jitters when you poke at it. It'd be a good
pre-cursor to other experiences I want to make like
"A Blob Named Bucket".
