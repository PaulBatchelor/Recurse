@09:33 Some write-ups for social media on tract
Here is what I wrote:
---
I have ported my tract filter to rust now [0]. I couldn't resist garnishing my "simple" example a little bit [1] to make it more musical and sing-y.
---
In addition to the bare minimum tract filter processing the glottal source, I've also added some controls over vibrato, amplitude, and tract shape (for vowel morphing). I tuned the tract shapes by ear using the distinct region model.
