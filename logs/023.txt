@2024-06-11 Day 23. Impossible Day.
60 days until EOB (end of batch).
---
Yesterday I was very tired and out of it. I did a
lot of walking over the weekend.
---
prev:
Unblock and reflect workshop, lunch with people
(Next Stop Vegan Festivals), some very baby steps into
a react applications. @!(taskref "react-tic-tac-toe")!@,
implemented a simple way to do preset import for singing synthesizer
demo @!(taskref "quick-preset-export")!@.

next: impossible day! I'm currently planning on breaking
my focus up into two parts. Some of my time will be spent working
with Jeff B drive some of his video filter with audio.
The other part of my time will be spent doing research
into FPGA gaming. I'll be studying @!(dzref
"FPGA/openfpga_pong")!@ and @!(dzref "FPGA/another_world_5k")!@

We were struggling getting zoom to work with the iOS

felt like I made a jerk of myself in front of everyone.
Oops.

John Cage once asked how he felt about his audience
laughing at some of his (admittedly odd) work, to which
he replied "I prefer laughter to tears". No tears, only
laughter. I suppose I was entertaining. So, I'll take the win.

@17:00 A Quiet and Fast and Hopefully Polite Exit Home #impossible-day
I think I am what you'd call an Introvert's Introvert. Being around
people at RC is quite enjoyable, but it has been draining
for me. I'm really starting to feel it.
I'll need to see what I can do to find some quiet
and recharge later this week.
---
Suddenly being around so many people after years
of being around so few is an ongoing adjustment for me.
Still, it is important to me that I try to push myself a bit
and coax myself out of my apartment into uncomfortable
situations. The people here are friendly.

@20:49 Some logging.

@20:50 Attempts at more of this react tutorial #react-tic-tac-toe

@21:06 Trying to get react developer tool exstension for firefox working #react-tic-tac-toe
The extension doesn't work on the current iteration of
react ("This page doesn't appear to be using React"),
but it does work on the React website.

Moving on with the tutorial without it.

@21:24 Left off: about to code things so that X's can be written in every box #react-tic-tac-toe
