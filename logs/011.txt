@2024-05-30 Day 11. Glottis algorithm in Rust, thoughts about Tract
More heads down today. Probably not going into the hub.
---
Prev: C Creatures, Chats, WASM Group, More Rust Audio Pairing
---
Next: Implement Glottis algorithm, and hopefully some
tract stuff?
@09:00 Morning Triage

@09:25 Didn't complete this yesterday. Completing today. #implement-glot

@09:26 Thinking about tackling some of this port today #implement-tract
I want to push myself to get some singing sounds in Rust by
the end of the week.

@09:32 Building glot initializer #implement-glot
Struct initialization feels like a pain point to me.

@09:55 HP/LP filter uses similar struct, how to do inheritance like things? #implement-glot
Using this as a learning opportunity.
---
Okay, looks like I want to implement a filter as a trait.
See: @!(dzref "rust/books/rust_by_example/traits")!@ and @!(dzref "rust/books/rust_book/traits")!@.

@10:12 Trying to get traits to work is premature optimization and too much time, making a new task for it. #implement-glot #refactor-glotfilt-traits
I want to set aside some time to actually do this right.
It's not quite fitting in my head at the moment, and I need
to keep moving forward. Ultimately, what we want is to be
able to have a nice way to define two two types: highpass
and lowpass, which are two types that use identical data
structs but slightly different methods.
---
I imagine it'll be pretty trivial to return and refactor.
So far, this has been my experience with Rust.

@10:16 Back to Butterworth porting #implement-glot
These are needed to filter the noise source in the glottal
model.

@10:18 Oh wait, I implemented the butterworth filter in boing^3 #implement-glot
I'll just copy that over. duh.

@10:23 Ugh, how do I use modules locally? need a refresher. #implement-glot
Revisiting @!(dzref "rust/organizing_code_project_structure")!@.
---
Here is the winning code block for imports.
===
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
use crate::butterworth::{ButterworthLowPass, ButterworthHighPass};
#+END_SRC
===
---
Also needed to make sure that lib.rs had butterworth
imported too.

@10:36 Back to filling out rest of the glot struct #implement-glot
I will need to return to implement the highpass filter.

@10:45 implement setup_waveform #implement-glot

@11:02 implement hanning table #implement-glot

@11:06 implement highpass #implement-glot

@11:09 initializer done. now some of the smaller methods #implement-glot

@11:15 Port tick function. #implement-glot

@11:30 I think there's enough in place for some initial sound #implement-glot

@11:37 Uh oh, it panicked. #implement-glot
There was an attempt to multiply with overflow. It seems
to be a problem with the RNG.
---
disabling noise source for now.

@11:40 No sound. Debugging in my future. #implement-glot

@11:55 troubleshooting: why isn't there any sound? #implement-glot
Here is the debug script:
===
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
rm -f glot_simple.wav
cargo run --example glot_simple
mnolth wavdraw glot_simple.wav glot_simple.pbm
#+END_SRC
===
---
ah. I didn't finish setup_waveform()

@12:12 Lunch

@13:11 Line by line checking with reference #implement-glot
I will log as I go.
---
setup_waveform: found multiply that should have been add.
otherwise, it looks okay.
---
settup_hanning_table looks good.
--
rest of initializer looks good.
--
tick(): I messed up most of the exp function translations.
Rust has a weird notation for this. instead of =exp(x)=,
rust does =x.exp()=.

@13:26 It seems to work! Now back to the LCG overflow issue. #implment-glot
Looking at checked multiplies, @!(dzref "rust/checked_mul")!@,
but that doesn't seem quite right. I want to do wraparound.
---
It seems to be okay with this solution:

===
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
fn rand(&mut self) -> u32 {
    self.rng = (self.rng.wrapping_mul(1103515245) + 12345) % LCG_MAX;
    return self.rng;
}
#+END_SRC
===
---
=wrapping_mul= was what I needed to keep the panic away.
See @!(dzref "rust/wrapping_mul")!@.

@14:00 final thoughts #implement-glot
I have finished porting the glottal source component
of my singing synthesizer from C to Rust. It was a bit
of a tedious effort, but luckily the setbacks were small.
---
The port can be found here: [[https://github.com/PaulBatchelor/voxbox/blob/main/src/glot.rs]].
---
Sample code writing to WAV file: [[https://github.com/PaulBatchelor/voxbox/blob/main/examples/glot_simple.rs]].
---
This implements a glottal source model based on the one
described by Hui-Ling Lu in their dissertation. It includes
a version of the LF glottal flow derivative waveform model
(based off an implementation by Neil Thapen of Pink Trombone),
as well as a synchronous pulsed noise component for
breathiness and aspiration.
---
On the first pass manually translating C to Rust, I ran
into some issues. Most of the issues ended up being related
to the way Rust handles math functions. Instead of doing
something like =exp(x)= like you'd expect, Rust tends
to use notation like =x.exp()=, and I messed up the notation.
---
By itself, the glottal source component sounds pretty
unremarkable. It will need a tract filter before it starts
to sound talky.

@15:09 publish glot algorithm to website.

@15:27 tract scaffolding #implement-tract

@15:38 Using tubular. Already realizing some porting issues. #implement-tract
Tubular @!(dzref "voxbox/tubular")!@ is the port I'll be
basing this off of, and already I can see I did a lot
of pointer stuff to manage buffers. I'll probably need
to peel things back a little bit and remember what I
was doing before going forward.

@15:56 Refamiliarize myself with Tubular. #implement-tract

@16:00 Actually got unstuck, getting initial struct initialized #implement-tract

@16:20 Initial struct made? setting up other bits in init #implement-tract

@16:29 tick scaffolding #implement-tract
@16:37 generate_reflection_coefficients #implement-tract
@16:46 compute_areas_from_diams #implement-tract
@16:49 compute_scattering_junctions #implement-tract
@17:00 closing up for the day
