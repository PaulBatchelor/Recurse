38 days left of batch.

Next

|| @!(taskref "resume-setup")!@: more structuring.
overengineering stuff (of course I would do this).

|| @!(taskref "create-chatter-sounds")!@: some initial
code setup for an example in VoxBox, and some
sound design planning because a version of this
will eventually end up in Poke.

|| @!(taskref "demo-react-UI")!@: Now that we've officially
started the basics, time to move along and get
all the sliders up.

@08:20 Morning Triage

@08:30 Finished. Next steps... #typescript-react-slider
Next steps are to port the rest of the UI
into React

@08:32 Ready to start working on this #demo-react-UI
I think I know enough now to start getting the
rest of this UI ported to React. I can just focus
on the UI elements first, and then worry about hooking
it up later.

@08:36 added earlier this morning #add-wasm-dz

@08:37 chatter sounds are needed for poke #create-chatter-sounds #demo-poke
The most important thing for this demo is the vocal-like
chattering. So this example will more or less aim to
build the model. The new thing to try out will be
morphing between DRM shapes. The critter here will be
quite small, so the tract size wlil be quite small.

I will be thinking more about the design today.

@08:40 Chatter sounds are precursor to morphing shapes with gesture #voxbox-shape-morphing
The chatter sound model will feature DRM shape morphing
using a pre-defined set of tract shapes. This will be
a simplified version of what I'm expecting to do
with the Gesture shape morphing. The chatter system will
interpolate using a phasor, but there won't be the
rephasor component. The code structure will also attempt
to be simplified as well.

@08:47 How to factor in leet-grinding into my schedule? #what-now-week7
I want to see how much I can do of the LC75 problem sets.

@08:51 Publishing and Zulip

@08:59 Making some initial tract states #create-chatter-sounds #timelog:00:35:23
Going to use my phone for this, as the touchscreen
is the best interface I have right now.

@09:32 shape exploration is slow and tedious #create-chatter-sounds
I need to find a better way

@09:43 Getting intial boilerplate code setup #create-chatter-sounds #timelog:00:27:00

@10:10 initial boilerplate with shapes created #create-chatter-sounds

@10:11 Time to modulate the shapes linearly with a phasor #create-chatter-sounds #timelog:00:15:28

@10:43 Structuring my graph using dagzet notation. #resume-setup #timelog:00:13:10
I think I want to implemented an ordered list command.

@11:00 Lunch

@11:30 Webdev hangout

@12:30 Audio hangout

@13:30 Back to hub

@14:10 Catching up with logs, hanging with Dan

@15:36 A small pocket of time.

@15:37 I need to implement some kind of jitter #create-chatter-sounds
Thinking about something like randi, but phasor-driven.
And a phasor that can have randomized periods.

@15:38 Testing out MIDI controller
