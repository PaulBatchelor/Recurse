lua script to generate tex code using my old
TeX template.

|| @!(taskref "how-big-are-react-apps")!@: Didn't

@07:49 Morning triage

@08:06 Planning Demo Poke tweaks #demo-poke
Visuals: eyes and mouth, make sure they all
collide against walls. Sounds: use envelope
to modulate pitch, used smoothed gate for
amplitude (decay doesn't work).
---
Resist the urge to tune and tweak all day.

@08:09 Plan: use existing data today to make Tex Generator #resume-setup

@08:11 Try to look into this today #how-big-are-react-apps

@08:13 Try to add sliders today #demo-react-UI
I'm honestly losing motivation for this, but
it's important to me that I do this in order to
learn.

@08:15 If there is time #investigate-kickstart-neovim
This is a pretty open day, so there's a chance I'll have
time for this.

@08:17 Two more chapters left here #react-managing-state
"passing data deeply" (23 pages) and "scaling up"
(20 pages)

@08:18 Publishing

@08:30 Let's work on a face for my little guy #demo-poke #timelog:00:16:03

@08:46 Initial face created. Next up: mouth sync #demo-poke #timelog:00:58:42
open/close and shape morphing

@09:24 Initial open/close created. Now to interpolate shapes. #demo-poke
