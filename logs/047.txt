Prev:

sounds and visuals /
connected together for /
the poking demo

Next:

|| @!(taskref "demo-poke")!@: add eyes and a mouth,
sync mouth shapes to sounds, tweak sounds.

|| @!(taskref "resume-setup")!@: work up a little
lua script to generate tex code using my old
TeX template.

|| @!(taskref "how-big-are-react-apps")!@: Didn't
get to this the other day. Experiment and observe.

|| @!(taskref "demo-react-UI")!@: Try to actually
get to adding sliders to this.

|| @!(taskref "investigate-kickstart-neovim")!@ if
there is time.

|| @!(taskref "react-managing-state")!@ read "passing
data deeply"

@07:49 Morning triage

@08:06 Planning Demo Poke tweaks #demo-poke
Visuals: eyes and mouth, make sure they all
collide against walls. Sounds: use envelope
to modulate pitch, used smoothed gate for
amplitude (decay doesn't work).
---
Resist the urge to tune and tweak all day.

@08:09 Plan: use existing data today to make Tex Generator #resume-setup

@08:11 Try to look into this today #how-big-are-react-apps

@08:13 Try to add sliders today #demo-react-UI
I'm honestly losing motivation for this, but
it's important to me that I do this in order to
learn.

@08:15 If there is time #investigate-kickstart-neovim
This is a pretty open day, so there's a chance I'll have
time for this.

@08:17 Two more chapters left here #react-managing-state
"passing data deeply" (23 pages) and "scaling up"
(20 pages)

@08:18 Publishing

@08:30 Let's work on a face for my little guy #demo-poke #timelog:00:16:03

@08:46 Initial face created. Next up: mouth sync #demo-poke #timelog:00:58:42
open/close and shape morphing

@09:24 Initial open/close created. Now to interpolate shapes. #demo-poke

@09:47 Testing on Android #demo-poke

@09:49 Where did the tap to begin go? #demo-poke

@09:55 Tuning and tweaking #demo-poke #timelog:00:49:37

@09:56 First up, expand the poking radius #demo-poke
Sometimes the pokes don't register because you are
out of bounds.

@10:00 Map envelope to fundamental pitch, rate, jitter #demo-poke

@10:16 add some jitter controlling velum #demo-poke

@10:22 remove some low end #demo-poke

@10:25 fine. add reverb #demo-poke

@10:32 draw the frame last #demo-poke
That way, eyeballs can go off screen.
I'm not going to do collision checks on mouth/eyes. Not
worth the time.

@10:39 More pitch tuning #demo-poke
I wasn't hearing what I wanted to hear. Turns out
the jitter was getting in the way.

10:45 Android testing again #demo-poke #timelog:00:03:38
Feels okay enough. Maybe a bit too shrill on phone
speakers. But I'll worry about mixing another time.

@10:50 Merged "chatter" branch in voxbox. #demo-poke

@10:54 can I still build my old tex resume? #resume-setup #timelog:01:00:06
Short answer is: no.
---
Okay, so I just want to preview the data right now.
I'm going to render to markup.

11:49 I wrote a CV in plain tex once, trying to compile #resume-setup
It still works good!
