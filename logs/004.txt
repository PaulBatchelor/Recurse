@09:00 Morning Logging
Raining today, might go into the hub later.
@09:48 VoxBox project setup thoughts #rust-proj-setup
Yesterday I pushed initial code:

https://github.com/paulBatchelor/voxbox

Used cargo to generate a library, with examples, similar
to my boing^3 library.

@09:51 oops guess I need to add the rest of the files #rust-proj-setup
Also setting up my adhoc workstation while doing this...

@10:01 Troubleshooting trackpad mouse
While setting up my adhoc workstation, my trackpad decided
not to work.

It was a faulty microusb cable. Tossed that in the trash.

@10:07 Back to adding more files to voxbox

@10:12 simple WAV file generators: didn't I do this already? #implement-monowav
I feel like I wrote a bare bones mono wav file generator
somewhere in C.

@10:18 can't find it, guess I'm doing it from scratch
going to write a quick and dirty one in C, then port it to
rust. Reviewing the spec now.

@10:54 Packing up to leave
Got side-tracked with Dan during this.

@12:12 Arrival

@12:33 Getting ready to work

@12:34 filling out initial chunks #implement-monowav

@12:44 Okay, poking at the hex data for the header #implement-monowav

@12:56 main chunk done, now data chunk
hex viewer is nice. I'm assuming it's only going to be
one data chunk with PCM.

What I'm not sure about is: how does it know to do 16-bit
and not like 10 or 12 bit?

@13:11 wav written, but afplay doesn't like it #implement-monowav

@13:14 Inspect riff data of reference
I figured there'd be a tool for this. exiftool looks to
be about right.

@13:16 why is the exif data saying my WAV has duration of 0? #implement-monowav

@13:26 Time to generate a smaller reference file #implement-monowav

@13:37 now we're only writing zeros #implement-monowav

@13:44 why is there weird junk in the reference zeros? #implement-monowav

@13:49 Don't know what the junk is, but the header is wrong #implement-monowav
I used sox to convert my generated wav into another wav,
and it fixed some things. I diffed the xxd'd output and
saw the header differences.

@13:57 36 byte difference between data payload chunk size and riff chunk size #implement-monowav
4 bytes for RIFF
16 bytes for fmt
16 bytes for data in riff?

@14:04 zerod wav works. now add sound. #implement-monowav

@14:08 off to lunch. next steps #implement-monowav
next steps: get dynamic file size working.

@15:07 Return from lunch. settled in. #implement-monowav
Now, to tackle the file size things. I'm anticipating
when I port this to Rust, I'll want to be able to write
the stream of an indefinite size, get the total samples
written to disk, and then update the header bits.

It would be nice to do that using someo kind of r/w
mode. Otherwise, just close and re-open.
@15:24 number of bytes acquired dynamically, now to update WAV
My Orphium project is updating stuff in-place, which flag
is it?
---
Ah, appears to be "a+".

@15:26 it seems to work without updates? #implement-monowav
Nevermind, just didn't update everything, and had
to go back to the beginning of the file. Be kind, and
rewind().

@15:28 back on track #implement-monowav

@15:43 It works!
Making it a commandline application to take in input/output
params.

@15:46 "a+" doesn't actually work like I thought it would
I just looked up the man pages. "w" is fine.

@15:48 things look good. next steps.
Next steps are to port a version of this code to rust
as a mono wav writer to boing^3. After that, it should
be ported to voxbox with some sine code to make sure I
can get WAV files generated.

@15:50 packing up, getting ready to watch presentations

@16:00 Apple 2e MIDI, rest bug, coltrane timing

@16:10 Neural nets as a musical instrument
DIY auto-encoder, RAVE: realtime auto-encoder, RAVE on
Daisy (hey I know these guys!) (didn't work), on norns?
Maybe I can help with the norns stuff?

@16:15 Evlish PL and shell, testing

@16:30 How to never miss a train

@16:40 Everything is an Object
pharo smalltalk VM

@16:46 Music tracking for the privacy conscious
Navidrone, clerk (clojure)

@16:52 Debugging and logging in vscode
"tech demo state"

@16:56 PSAs and how to think about time at RC
Use checkin stream, show links in zulip. "closed" on
monday. kind vs nice: try to be kind.

@17:15 head back home
