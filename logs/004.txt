Raining today, might go into the hub later.
@09:48 VoxBox project setup thoughts #rust-proj-setup
Yesterday I pushed initial code:

https://github.com/paulBatchelor/voxbox

Used cargo to generate a library, with examples, similar
to my boing^3 library.

@09:51 oops guess I need to add the rest of the files #rust-proj-setup
Also setting up my adhoc workstation while doing this...

@10:01 Troubleshooting trackpad mouse
While setting up my adhoc workstation, my trackpad decided
not to work.

It was a faulty microusb cable. Tossed that in the trash.

@10:07 Back to adding more files to voxbox
