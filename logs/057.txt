event-driven gesture interface

|| @!(taskef "dagzet-rust")!@: more dagzet work, cuz
I didn't get to it yesterday.

Very tired and groggy today. I've been going to bed
too late, and waking up too early.

@08:41 Morning Triage

@08:42 After all that work yesterday, I didn't use any of it #linear-gesture-interface
I'll briefly try to defend the notion that it was mostly
a good effort. For starters, I got very a convenient linear
gesture interface, which required some moderate thinking
about design in rust with ownership in mind. Secondly,
I got Rust code working in mnolth for the first time, and
this is important because it shows that I can leverage
what I've done before to boost what I'm working on
right now.

@08:45 As it turns out, there was no time yesterday. #dagzet-rust

@09:01 hoping to start work on event-driven gesture today #event-driven-gesture
Using the trait system in place, the problem is a matter
of how to build the "next" gesture. I'm thinking of
implementing an event queue, possibly fixed sized.
---
I think the plan is to have this work in a single-threaded
context first, then building abstractions around that
inside of an existing event system. (in a webaudio worklet,
this would wrap around the "onmessage" passing interface
used).

@09:11 Publishing.
Zulip will be a re-cap of last week with a link to
the weekly page.
