@2024-07-15 Day 57. Event-driven Gesture, Dagzet, Testing in Rust
25 days left of batch.

Prev:

Wanted lines with sound /
Built the necessary tools /
Abandoned the Thought

Next:

|| @!(taskref "event-driven-gesture")!@: initial work on
event-driven gesture interface

|| @!(taskref "dagzet-rust")!@: more dagzet work, cuz
I didn't get to it yesterday.

---

Very tired and groggy today. I've been going to bed
too late, and waking up too early.

@08:41 Morning Triage

@08:42 After all that work yesterday, I didn't use any of it #linear-gesture-interface
I'll briefly try to defend the notion that it was mostly
a good effort. For starters, I got very a convenient linear
gesture interface, which required some moderate thinking
about design in rust with ownership in mind. Secondly,
I got Rust code working in mnolth for the first time, and
this is important because it shows that I can leverage
what I've done before to boost what I'm working on
right now.

@08:45 As it turns out, there was no time yesterday. #dagzet-rust

@09:01 hoping to start work on event-driven gesture today #event-driven-gesture
Using the trait system in place, the problem is a matter
of how to build the "next" gesture. I'm thinking of
implementing an event queue, possibly fixed sized.
---
I think the plan is to have this work in a single-threaded
context first, then building abstractions around that
inside of an existing event system. (in a webaudio worklet,
this would wrap around the "onmessage" passing interface
used).

@09:11 Publishing.
Zulip will be a re-cap of last week with a link to
the weekly page.

@09:50 dagzet in rust today #dagzet-rust #timelog:01:24:57

@09:53 Beginning initial top-level struct #dagzet-rust
Eventually this will be populated with data from
the commands.

@10:02 Now would be a good time to figure out rust docstrings #dagzet-rust
Being able to add in-line descriptions of struct
contents that get rendered to rust documentation
would be helpful.

@10:44 namespace and graph remarks mostly figured out #dagzet-rust
I have a incremental TDD approach to porting this,
which feels nice.

@10:45 Make use of =Option= to indicate uninitialized values #dagzet-rust

@11:14 Better error handling, new node command incomplete #dagzet-rust
I'm making use of Result and putting return codes
into a single Enum. This is just mirroring how I'd
do it in C. Hopefully it's idiomatic enough in Rust.

@13:49 Gesture event queue initial scaffolding #event-driven-gesture #timelog:01:46:56

@14:27 What are the common verbs used to describe queueo operatoins? #event-driven-gesture
push/pop makes sense to me, but those are stack terms not
queue terms.
---
Wikipedia tells me they use the terms "dequeue" and
"enqueue".
---
Side note: my tired brain is having a great time parsing
the "ueue"s of these words. Imagine if you pronounced it
"wehweh". Hilarious.

@14:59 Unions are unsafe. doh. #event-driven-gesture
I'm kludging it into a struct with optionals
for now. This doesn't spark joy. I'm going to test this
well, and when/if I refactor, I can rely on these tests.

@15:11 Get tests working for pushing other event types #event-driven-gesture

@15:15 interface is wrong. too much data allocation #event-driven-gesture
For enqueue, I should only be passing specific data types,
and then mutating the internal event array. Right now,
deep copying an entire event.
---
For dequeue, I should either return a reference or an id
that eventually resolve to a reference.

@15:49 More work on dagzet in rust #dagzet-rust #timelog:00:35:58

@15:50 Let's run clippy on my dagzet project so far #dagzet-rust

Turns out it doesn't have a lot to say.
Voxbox, on the other hand, is a mess.

@15:52 cargo clippy is a mess on this repo #voxbox-cargo-clippy
I also think some of the examples are broken?

@16:19 finished new node command, now lines. #dagzet-rust

@16:32 Looking at bytebeat stuff with dan

@17:09 pairing on visuals

019:00 home

@20:25 back to dagzet #dagzet-rust #timelog:00:22:25
added a lines command. now I'm very tired.
