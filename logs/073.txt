@2024-07-31 Day 73.
9 days left of batch.
---
I stayed up too late again. I am tired. I did
try sleeping in a little bit though. Going to have to pace
myself.
---
I have just signed up for a presentation slot.
So, I gotta enough working for that today.

@08:34 Morning Triage

@09:00 Hoping to improve chord selection today #demo-trio-chord-improvements
It chooses chords too quickly (when the lead changes),
and should only think about changing chords when
the lower/upper notes happen. I had a concept of
"committing" to a chord. A faster thing might be to
just move the chord changes to when the lower note
triggers rather than the lead.
---
Also, I want tonic bias. Every 4 non-tonic chords or so,
there should be a switch that puts tonic as priority,
it if it is available as a candidate.

@09:25 Publish

@09:27 Attempts to get better chords working. #demo-trio-chord-improvements

@09:48 The quick fix makes things sound MUCH better now. #demo-trio-chord-improvements #timelog:00:18:34
I've just been noodling on this thing for the past
15 minutes.

@09:52 Tweaked the tract lengths too #demo-trio

@09:55 revisit mobile, add smoothing, and other things. publish #demo-trio #timelog:01:15:28

@10:02 shoot I am having too much fun with this thing it's working it's really working #demo-trio
That's how I know this is close.

@10:04 Okay for real, smoothing. #demo-trio

@10:18 My phone is almost definitely running at a higher sampling rate #demo-trio
I want to see if I can get the webaudio API to request
a sampling rate (44.1kHz) because the voices are just
going to sound better.
---
I am now coming to understand why gnuspeech decided to
go the route of resampling from 16kHz to the host sampling
rate. It's just going to sound better that way. The changes
sound too weird.

@10:46 Getting caught up in tweaking the "ooo" vocal shape #demo-trio
I'm finding it's very hard to find in my interface, because
the sliders end up being very close to zero. I almost
feel the urge to have a min/max slider too to be able
to "zoom in".

@11:04 Reqeusted sample rate of 44.khz. Sounds better now #demo-trio

@11:08 Time to upload this thing. #demo-trio

@11:14 Uploaded. #demo-trio
