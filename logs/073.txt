I stayed up too late again. I am tired. I did
try sleeping in a little bit though. Going to have to pace
myself.

I have just signed up for a presentation slot.
So, I gotta enough working for that today.

@08:34 Morning Triage

@09:00 Hoping to improve chord selection today #demo-trio-chord-improvements
It chooses chords too quickly (when the lead changes),
and should only think about changing chords when
the lower/upper notes happen. I had a concept of
"committing" to a chord. A faster thing might be to
just move the chord changes to when the lower note
triggers rather than the lead.
---
Also, I want tonic bias. Every 4 non-tonic chords or so,
there should be a switch that puts tonic as priority,
it if it is available as a candidate.
