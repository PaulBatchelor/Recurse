@2024-08-03 Day 76. c2rust, XM Players in Rust, More Coax
6 days left of batch.
@10:40 Late morning triage.
@11:05 Publishing
@11:10 Taking a fresh look at this thing. #blob-coax #timelog:00:13:04
It really should aim to choose the closest pellet.
---
The only sound I have in mind right now are the
sounds of placing pellets. One of those bubble
popping sounds. Like the sounds on the switch.
---
The "consume and become larger" mechanic was
an interesting ad-hoc idea. But it's Katamari
Damacy. I should look into that game. They
have a crazy soundtrack from what I remember.
---
I want to play with better colors here. Manic
Japanese pastel colors. Think Kirby and Mario.
---
I think this game soundtrack should feel very
tactile.

@11:21 Doing some code cleanup. #blob-coax

@11:22 I still want cheezy bossa nova somehow. #blob-coax
Maybe try to get this working in a tracker?

@11:23 compiling c2rust #investigate-c2rust
Looks like you can just do "cargo install c2rust",
which is pretty awesome if it just works.
---
LLVM issues. Installed llvm-dev, trying again
---
another error: libLLVMDemangle.a does not exist

@11:30 Ugh. maybe a dead end. #investigate-c2rust

@11:34 oooh. there's an llvm17-static #investigate-c2rust
Let's see if this works.
---
Restarting, then trying again. The library *does*
seem to be there.

@11:42 libLLVMTestingAnnotations.a missing now
I found an arch page that has it in LLVM18. I installed
LLVM17. Let's see if that does anything.

@11:52 Same deal. Giving up. #investigate-c2rust
The most promising command so far:
---
#+BEGIN_SRC c
LLVM_CONFIG_PATH=llvm-config-18 cargo install c2rust
#+END_SRC

@13:51 I don't need c2rust afterall! #investigate-c2rust
Someone already made it. See @!(dzref "rust/crates/xmrsplayer")!@.

@13:55 Testing xmrsplayer #investigate-xmrsplayer
See: @!(dzref "rust/crates/xmrsplayer")!@.
---
Well it builds, but once again I run into the usual
snags with CPal and ALSA.
---
People, add a fallback offline wav writer. Jeez.

@14:03 There's a "bufferedsource" example #investigate-xmrsplayer
Wonder how hard it would be to work that into a
my monwav voxbox writer.

@14:07 Create a new xmplayer project in my scratch #investigate-xmrsplayer #timelog:01:07:06
Did not know you coul do the thing with
"cargo add xmrsplayer". That was so easy.
---
But ah yes, now the infamous build time.

@14:20 sidetracked: nectarine in mplayer?
It works!

@14:27 back to it now. #investigate-xmrsplayer

@14:58 Some sound, but it's very faint. #investigate-xmrsplayer

@15:05 Clicks. Clicks in the output. #investigate-xmrsplayer
I am not getting a warm feeling about this one.

@15:07 Trying another XM file (acid-jazzed evening) #investigate-xmrsplayer
No clicks, but this one is out of tune. Also very soft
gain.

@15:11 Nevermind. #investigate-xmrsplayer
Not worth the time investment here.

@15:36 Playing my thingy while listening to bossa-nova music #blob-coax #timelog:00:20:05
wii music: good vibe. something about the timing
---
getz/gilberto girl from ipanema: there's something
more playful about this pairing. I think it's cuz
there's a bit more of film cliche happening.
---
Severance OST Theodire Shapiro "Labor of Love":
The triangle makes this very funny. It's definitely
a matter of tempo.
---
wii shop: ~170 BPM, ipanema: ~140 BPM, severance: ~125BPM.a
---
Desafinado Gilberto/Jobim/Getz ~140 BPM. This one
also is very playful juxtaposition.

@15:56 rework blob to go over closest #blob-coax #timelog:00:08:38

@16:41 Got sidetracked trying to build Bun on alpine. #blob-coax
Didn't actually get anything done. Heading out.

@19:37 Back to trying to get "eat closest" working #blob-coax #timelog:00:33:01
Had a nice high-level chat with RB about a possible
implementation. He called it an "object pool", which is
pretty much exactly what I'm going after.
