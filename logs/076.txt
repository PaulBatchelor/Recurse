@2024-08-03 Day 76.
@10:40 Late morning triage.
@11:05 Publishing
@11:10 Taking a fresh look at this thing. #blob-coax #timelog:00:13:04
It really should aim to choose the closest pellet.
---
The only sound I have in mind right now are the
sounds of placing pellets. One of those bubble
popping sounds. Like the sounds on the switch.
---
The "consume and become larger" mechanic was
an interesting ad-hoc idea. But it's Katamari
Damacy. I should look into that game. They
have a crazy soundtrack from what I remember.
---
I want to play with better colors here. Manic
Japanese pastel colors. Think Kirby and Mario.
---
I think this game soundtrack should feel very
tactile.

@11:21 Doing some code cleanup. #blob-coax

@11:22 I still want cheezy bossa nova somehow. #blob-coax
Maybe try to get this working in a tracker?

@11:23 compiling c2rust #investigate-c2rust
Looks like you can just do "cargo install c2rust",
which is pretty awesome if it just works.
---
LLVM issues. Installed llvm-dev, trying again
---
another error: libLLVMDemangle.a does not exist

@11:30 Ugh. maybe a dead end. #investigate-c2rust

@11:34 oooh. there's an llvm17-static #investigate-c2rust
Let's see if this works.
---
Restarting, then trying again. The library *does*
seem to be there.

@11:42 libLLVMTestingAnnotations.a missing now
I found an arch page that has it in LLVM18. I installed
LLVM17. Let's see if that does anything.

@11:52 Same deal. Giving up. #investigate-c2rust
The most promising command so far:
---
#+BEGIN_SRC c
LLVM_CONFIG_PATH=llvm-config-18 cargo install c2rust
#+END_SRC
