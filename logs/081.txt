@2024-08-08 Day 81.
1 day left of batch.

@09:22 Morning Triage.

@09:26 Probably not going to finish this. #blob-coax
But I have a working demo that I think I can
post today.

@09:27 I've read enough of this book #read-elem-compsys
I think it'd be a good exercise at some point
to go back and try working through the exercises.
But, for now, I think I'm at a decent enough
stopping point.

@09:30 What's a good stopping point for this #itparser-rust
I think it would be nice to work this out in such a way
that it exports JSON data for the patterns. Probably
just low-level row information for now (Serde?).
Later that can data can be analyzed by other programs
to do things like extract notes and durations and
so on.

@09:50 Publishing.
