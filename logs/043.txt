Prev:

The creeping answer
Of a gigantic bug hunt:
Check for foreign nodes.

Next:

|| @!(taskref "add-wasm-dz")!@: missing file in my
repo, on one of my computers. Quick thing.

|| @!(taskref "resume-setup")!@: read the way to
set up resume, and make a new one.

|| @!(taskref "demo-poke")!@: pre-work on this

|| @!(taskref "typescript-react-slider")!@: studied
the boilerplate yesterday, I feel ready enough to
add a slider.

|| @!(taskref "troubleshoot-webaudio-thinkpad")!@
This would be very helpful to figure out today.

@08:26 Morning Triage

@08:33 Do this at lunch today #add-wasm-dz

@08:36 Plans on doing this today #resume-setup

@08:39 Pre-work on this today #demo-poke
Goal will be to figure out initial technical
scaffolding, getting p5 in a windowed context,
mouse pointer stuff, etc.

@08:41 added a task for ensemble demo #demo-ensemble
This will build on the vocal chords demo, and
will most likely be something vaguely like
Blob Opera and Choir. Slightly lower priority
than @!(taskref "demo-poke")!@ because that
task will let me focus on details for one
face and voice, which can be a helpful learning
experience when I go to do the choir app.

@08:43 An actual demos page would be useful this week #add-demos-page
This shouldn't take any time at all.

@08:45 Ready to actual add a slider now #typescript-react-slider
After studying the boilerplate in way too much detail
yesterday @!(dzref "codestudy/hello_ts_react/app_tsx")!@,
I feel ready for this.

@08:48 I really need to make it possible to link graphs #dzgraph-hyperlinks
You can't actually use =dzref= to link to graphs, only
nodes. Hoping to fix that cuz it comes up a lot.

@08:51 Poke demo is priority this week #demo-poke
It's a good contrast from the vocal chords demo,
and a good way to start the more whimsical toyetic
vocal demos.

@08:56 publishing logs from yesterday

@09:03 Let's see if I can find more things out on this #troubleshoot-webaudio-thinkpad #timelog:00:32:02

@09:06 Glicol works, but my project does not #troubleshoot-webaudio-thinkpad
This has been a repeating theme: my audio code
doesn't work everywhere, but Glicol does tend to work
everywhere. Why?

@09:07 Glancing at glicol JS audoi code #troubleshoot-webaudio-thinkpad
Found an interesting line:

===
#+BEGIN_SRC
window.AudioContext = window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudiotContext
#+END_SRC
===

@09:17 Sound is broken in glicol now #troubleshoot-webaudio-thinkpad
More importantly: sounds suddenly worked for my vocal
demo?

@09:27 Not sure why but I guess it's all working now #troubleshoot-webaudio-thinkpad
Both my vocal chords and glicol demo work.
---
I did do some cache clearing in the dev tools, so
that could be partially to blame for why it's
suddenly deciding to work.

@09:30 webkit is safari? #troubleshoot-webaudio-thinkpad #vocal-chords-older-iphone
Unrelated, but that webkit line may be how to
get sound working on some iphone devices.
---
I've made a new task for this @!(taskref "vocal-chords-older-iphone")!@.
