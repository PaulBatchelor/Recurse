@13:06 nose tick function porting: right junction equation looks wrong #implement-velum
Above it is the computation for the left junction. I'd imagine
a symmetry between them, but it is not symmetrical. The
original voc source code looks like this as well. I think I may
have to go back to Pink trombone and check on it. At some point.
In the meantime, I've dropped a TODO.

@13:32 Hooking nose with tract in tick function #implement-velum

@13:49 Try to an initial example up and running. #implement-velum

@13:52 Uh-oh. Overflow with the existing example. #implement-velum
It's the damn LCG again in the glottis.

@14:01 tract example sounds chipmunky now #implement-velum
going off track a little bit

@14:20 Got a nice throat-singing patch going. No nose yet. #implement-velum
But it sounds cool. Might want to import my reverb for added effect.

@14:26 Okay it blew up. Fizzled into high frequency. #implement-velum
But the good news is that it did build.

@14:27 This is a good enough stopping point #implement-velum
I gotta get ready for a presentation.
