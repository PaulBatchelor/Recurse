@2024-06-07 Day 19. Initial velum implementation. The NanHunt begins.
Prev: game jam. some velum stuff.
---
Next: logging presentation for tool-time, velum.

@07:25 hand-draw site ecosystem, brainstorm presentation format #logging-presentation

@08:25 get dot graphs working #logging-presentation
Transfer inked up outline to graphviz dot format.

See: scratch/how_logging_works.
---
Useful guide on writing graphs with dot: @!(dzref "misc/dotguide")!@.

@09:00 get initial presentation wiki page going. #logging-presentation
see: @!(ref "how_logging_works")!@

@09:06 Logging overview page #logging-overview

@09:23 Logging Pipeline #logging-overview
Gotta get images working now...

@09:40 Site Ecosystem #logging-overview

@09:48 Logging format #logging-overview

@10:09 make sure things upload okay #logging-overview
images are new, just want to make sure that code works
okay.

@10:18 Practice presentation, make tweaks #logging-overview

@10:42 Catch up on yesterday's logs

@13:06 nose tick function porting: right junction equation looks wrong #implement-velum
Above it is the computation for the left junction. I'd imagine
a symmetry between them, but it is not symmetrical. The
original voc source code looks like this as well. I think I may
have to go back to Pink trombone and check on it. At some point.
In the meantime, I've dropped a TODO.

@13:32 Hooking nose with tract in tick function #implement-velum

@13:49 Try to an initial example up and running. #implement-velum

@13:52 Uh-oh. Overflow with the existing example. #implement-velum
It's the damn LCG again in the glottis.

@14:01 tract example sounds chipmunky now #implement-velum
going off track a little bit

@14:20 Got a nice throat-singing patch going. No nose yet. #implement-velum
But it sounds cool. Might want to import my reverb for added effect.

@14:26 Okay it blew up. Fizzled into high frequency. #implement-velum
But the good news is that it did build.

@14:27 This is a good enough stopping point #implement-velum
I gotta get ready for a presentation.

@15:00 Tool-time workshop!
Wiki page I presented from: @!(ref "how_logging_works")!@.

@15:38 Debugging what went wrong #implement-velum
Line by line debugging, comparing to reference C file.
Yick.

@16:18 Pretty sure the nose.tick() function is the culprit #implement-velum
looking at it again. I have tried to clean up the code to make it
more readable.

@16:27 Nasal is a NaN! #implement-velum
Must be dividing by zero somewhere.

@16:32 NaN checking: no nans in nose reflections #implement-velum

@16:34 NaN checking: NaN introduced during scattering junctions #implement-velum
=ns_r= and =ns_l= both have it (which makes sense). Not sure
which one gets it first. Going to check above.

@16:42 Finding the earliest NaN #implement-velum
Listing these as I go.
---
1367: =tr_jr[nose_start]=.
---
1367: =tr_l[nose_start]= is NaN before =tr_jr[nose_start]=.

@16:53 Taking a break from NaNs #implement-velum
NaN-hunting fries my brain.

@16:59 NanHunting: A little more digging #implement-velum
So far, I believe =tr_l[nose_start]= to be the earliest
introduction of a NaN as sample position 1367.

@17:07 NaN introduced into tract left 1 sample earlier, after nasal #implement-velum
=tr_l[nose_start]= has a NaN at 1366 at the end of the computation
loop, after the nasal component is made. It happens
right after =update_waveguide=.

@17:09 Following update_waveguide #implement-velum
=tr_l= is copying over =tr_jl= with a multiply by 0.999.
Where is the last place junction left is begin updated?

@17:11 Following last update of junction left #implement-velum

@17:17 I have lost the trail. Will start again tomorrow #implement-velum

@17:20 Final NaN thoughts #implement-velum
Junction Left at the nose start is the earliest instance
of a NaN I have found in my code. At 1366, it is introduced
before the nose tick, but after compute scattering junctions.
