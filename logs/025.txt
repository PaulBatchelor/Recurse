@07:19 Morning Triage #morning-triage #timelog 19:25

@07:27 initial thoughts on chords demo #morning-triage #chords-demo
I'm thinking about building a simple web demo involving 4
voices, reverb, and some buttons that allow you to switch
between chords. Probably just 4 or 5 buttons with chord
states. It would be cool to be able to switch out chord
sounds too.

@07:34 Getting ready to write Zulip Check-in

@07:46 Final wrap-up for morning triage

@07:56 What are we in for for? #react-thinking-in-react
Looks like a small overview page, with some follow-up links.

@07:57 Follow-up link tasks created #react-thinking-in-react #react-installation #react-describing-the-ui
(Other tasks linked here).

@07:59 Start reading. #react-thinking-in-react #timelog 30:12

@08:36 off to whole foods
I need to get chip clips (for holding my remarkable in place
on easel) and maybe chocolate.

@09:30 Back. What to do now?

@09:35 planning things for this #create-dagzet-todo-page #timelog 12:20
Thinking about abusing my tagging system in my logs
to link TODO tasks with dagzet items.

@09:39 Added dztodo utility. #create-dagzet-todo-page
It just worked out of the box which is nice.

@09:41 just thought up the "timelog" hashtag convention today #create-time-log-format

@09:42 attempt to link task to dznode #react-first-component #dz-webdev-react-your-first-component
The "dz" is the prefix for a node in the dagzet. following that is the
path, with slashes "/" replaced with dashes "-".
---
As a proof of concept, I'll need to write a program that can
use this log entry to link the task it belongs to the dagzet
node being referenced here.

@09:44 Testing out linking #create-dagzet-todo-page #test-dz-log-task-linking
I've also created a proof of concept

@09:46 The test page will be react first component, linked here #test-dz-log-task-linking #react-first-component
Will follow up on this... at some point.

@09:58 Create Voice abstraction #chords-demo #timelog 33:14
This will make it easier to spin up voice demos.
---
Moving Nose to its own file.
---
Creating Voice file with struct
---
Adding Voice example. Does this make the unused warning go away?
Oh, nevermind. I wasn't making the struct public.

@10:34 Break

@10:47 Building up an initial chord #chords-demo #timelog 20:37
Wow, it sounds bad.

@11:20 Lunch

@12:20 Better ah sound #chord-demo #timelog 59:04

@13:36 Tuning to Voce8 Eric Whitacre chord at 21s #chord-demo
https://youtu.be/aynHSTsYcUo?t=21

@14:21 Gesture Path Initial Scaffolding #implement-gesture-path #timelog 55:03

@14:37 Moving over to linux box.

@15:39 Let's see if I can get this design right for choosing the next vertex #implement-gesture-path #timelog 15:17

@16:02 Got an initial trait that compiles. Not sure this is the design I want though. #implement-gesture-path

@16:03 Off to Hub

@16:15 Jam With Dan and Scott

@20:09 Trying to compile potential vcv now #compile-potential-vcv
Got a make error.
---
Reading through Rack dev tutorial [[https://vcvrack.com/manual/Building]]
---
Okay this is going to take a while. Sigh. Will get back to this.

20:30 Back at it #compile-potential-vcv #timelog 17:22
20:45 It builds, and it seems to open up in VCV Rack #compile-potential-vcv
I put the potential repo in the plugins folder of the Rack
directory. Also, compiled Rack from source.

21:00 Okay I've seen enough. I'll have to see what I can do to study this. #compile-potential-vcv
