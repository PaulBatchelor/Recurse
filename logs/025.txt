@07:27 initial thoughts on chords demo #morning-triage #chords-demo
I'm thinking about building a simple web demo involving 4
voices, reverb, and some buttons that allow you to switch
between chords. Probably just 4 or 5 buttons with chord
states. It would be cool to be able to switch out chord
sounds too.
