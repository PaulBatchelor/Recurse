@2024-06-22 Day 35.
48 Days left of batch.
---
Thinkpad ordered yesterday. Should be arriving by the 28th,
So, I'll have about 40 days or so of use with it while
I'm here. I got a quote for the m1, and it was less
than I expected, so I might still do that. With the thinkpad,
I'll never have any days where I'm without a portable
computer. This is the important thing.
---
I was thinking all day about "A Blob Named Bucket", doing
research on game engines and graphics libraries, and
trying to get things to work on my Linux box. I think the
best contender so far is Sokol. I'm hoping to do most of
the game logic in Rust. A hybridized C + Rust approach
may work too, if I can get it all compiled down to a wasm
file working on the web.

@09:20 I turn on my computer and create this log file.

@09:27 Found this 2d sprite repo today with sokol/sdl. Looks perfect. #investigate-2d-gameengine
link: [[https://github.com/seyhajin/webgl2-wasm-sdl-sokol-sprite]].
---
WASM builds and runs okay with emcc. I was hoping it would
have had a sprite moving, but it's just projecting a static
texture.
---
I'm starting to feel diminishing returns, as this
"simple idea" might turn out to be not as simple as I
thought, and might require more time/focus than I have
right now.
---
Fail early. Fail often.

@09:55 Back to studying "sapp" #investigate-2d-gameengine #timelog:00:04:52
the "spine" examples seemed to be closest to what I was
looking for, but it turns out it's also not what I'm looking
for and intended for much larger games that I'd like to
build: [[http://en.esotericsoftware.com/spine-in-depth]].

@10:00 Trying out a Sokol add-on for 2d graphics someone made #investigate-2d-gameengine #timelog:00:12:07

---
The OSX build in this makefile is out of date. Getting errors.
I'd like to see this work, so I'm going to try and get
this running on my Linux box. If that fails, I'm back
to just learning more about =sokol_gfx.h= and actually
reading the documentation.
---
Okay! The makefile works on my Linux box! Good. Progress.
---
Making a dagzet graph for sokol.

@10:17 Studying sokol_gfx more in depth #investigate-2d-gameengine
I want to get the text rendered to a PDF somehow, so I can
read it on my remarkable.
---
Learned about =:hardcopy= in vim. =:hardcopy > foo.ps=.
---
set popts+=number:y will include line numbers
---
There are two kinds of programmers: those who understand
why text editors have a "hardcopy" printing feature in
2024, and those who do not.
---
Uploaded PDF to Remarkable.

@10:30 Reading =sokol_gfx= header comments on remarkable #investigate-2d-gameengine
