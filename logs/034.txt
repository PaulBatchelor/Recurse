@2024-06-22 Day 34. Investigating 2d game engines. Thinkpad ordered.
49 Days left of batch.
---
Saturday. Nothing really planned. This is intentional.

@10:02 Initial concept sketches #blob-brainstorm #timelog:00:10:36
@10:35 Late morning logging.
@10:42 How hard is it to throw some pixels to a framebuffer in webgl? #blob-brainstorm #timelog:00:42:09
let's find out!

@14:20 Exploring pixels #investigate-2d-gameengine #timelog:00:11:15

Space invaders example works on my Mac. Good lord that's
a lot of dependencies though (it's okay, it's okay, just
grit your teeth and do it).
---
Web example runs on my mac. Noticing use of wasm-bindgen.
Is it time for me to bite the bullet and actually learn
this? I wouldn't be able to get it done in a weekend.

@14:34 Now time to look at Sokol #investigate-2d-gameengine #timelog:00:08:12
Link: [[https://github.com/floooh/sokol]].
---
More "comfortable" because it's closer to a tech stack I
know already. I've never used it before, so the learning
curve may be just as big. But let's see!
---
Sigh... Emscripten.
---
Uhhhh... my harddrive just filled up I think.
---
This is an omen. I am ditching Sokol for this.

@14:43 Freeing up space on my harddrive
Damn. Fast internet fills up disk space quickly.

@14:55 Now we try Pixels on my Linux box #investigate-2d-gameengine #timelog:00:08:49
This is the ultimate test because nothing every wants to work.

@15:05 Well that didn't work. Attempting softbuffer on Alpine Linux? #investigate-2d-gameengine #timelog:00:07:59
Link: [[https://github.com/rust-windowing/softbuffer]].

@15:14 Well that's a no go. Sokol on Alpine linux? #investigate-2d-gameengine #timelog:00:08:10
Good ol' glfw backend works. I do not really like the strange build system.

@15:24 Another stab at pixels on Alpine linux. #investigate-2d-gameengine

@15:27 Trying sway to try run sway. wish me luck. #investigate-2d-gameengine #timelog:00:58:26

@16:23 Got enough of sway working to re-run pixels invaders example. Still, no luck #investigate-2d-gameengine
I'm starting to think a solution might involving having
different backends, with as much logic in the Rust layer.
This might take too long as well. Sigh. Graphics.
