@2024-07-17 Day 58.
23 days left of batch.

Note to self: 3 time 7 is 21. 23 days feels like
a small amount of time to me. And it is. But
it's also a little over 3 weeks, and when I
say it like that it feels like more time.

@08:17 Morning Triage

@08:37 follow-up #impossible-day-2
I figured out that some of the example
game does have sound working. I don't
know what I am missing here.

Don't think I'll have much more time for
this during my batch though.

@08:58 I need to scrap this project, or plan a demo #tic80-voxbox
I don't think I can justify putting more time into this,
unless I can make something that is presentable.

@09:02 Hoping to get an example by end of day. #event-driven-gesture
