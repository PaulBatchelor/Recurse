@2024-07-17 Day 58.
23 days left of batch.
---
Note to self: 3 time 7 is 21. 23 days feels like
a small amount of time to me. And it is. But
it's also a little over 3 weeks, and when I
say it like that it feels like more time.

Sounds on the gameboy /
worked in the emulator /
not on the real thing

Next:

|| @!(taskref "tic80-voxbox")!@: I either need to
scrap this project, or turn this into a presentable
demo

forward with this, try to get a working proof of
concept by today

imported into knowledge graph

@08:17 Morning Triage

@08:37 follow-up #impossible-day-2
I figured out that some of the example
game does have sound working. I don't
know what I am missing here.

Don't think I'll have much more time for
this during my batch though.

@08:58 I need to scrap this project, or plan a demo #tic80-voxbox
I don't think I can justify putting more time into this,
unless I can make something that is presentable.

@09:02 Hoping to get an example by end of day. #event-driven-gesture

@09:05 Publishing

@09:11 Extracting links and resources from CE's page #timelog:00:36:40

@10:04 back to this event queue #event-driven-gesture #timelog:01:26:19

@10:05 Did I rework the abstraction already? #event-driven-gesture

@10:11 Making clippy happy. #event-driven-gesture
I don't love this. This feels like busywork.

@10:16 Monowav errors with cargo clippy #event-driven-gesture
I'm crashing when I run cargo clippy. Let's make
it not crash. I can deal with the warnings later.

@10:26 Back to event queue, gotta work with other types #event-driven-gesture
Scalars are being handled, now to work with the other
types.

@10:47 I am annoyed with clippy now #event-driven-gesture
This is why nothing gets done. I've been wasting time
trying to make Clippy happy all in the name of supposedly "better"
code, and I'm almost 45 minutes with nothing to show.

It warps the brain, seeing all these squigglys in an editor.
Like a teacher marking up an essay in red. I don't think
it's actually possible to turn syntax off in nvim. The
usualy "syntax off" trick doesn't work.

@10:49 I think the event queue is done? #event-driven-gesture
I think it's reasonable to think about starting
the Gesture.

@10:52 Incorporating initial event queue into Gesture. #event-driven-gesture
I'm liking these incremental tests. What's a good way to
test that things are working as expected?
---
For starters, I need to be able to initialize this gesture
by pushing an initial set of events.

@11:31 got a test to pass for producing first event #event-driven-gesture
