@2024-07-17 Day 59. Eventful Gestures and Dagzet
23 days left of batch.
---
Note to self: 3 times 7 is 21. 23 days feels like
a small amount of time to me. And it is. But
it's also a little over 3 weeks, and when I
say it like that it feels like more time.

Prev:

Sounds on the gameboy /
worked in the emulator /
not on the real thing

Next:

|| @!(taskref "tic80-voxbox")!@: I either need to
scrap this project, or turn this into a presentable
demo

|| @!(taskref "event-driven-gesture")!@ keep moving
forward with this, try to get a working proof of
concept by today

|| @!(taskref "compeng-resources")!@ Get resources
imported into knowledge graph

@08:17 Morning Triage

@08:37 follow-up #impossible-day-2
I figured out that some of the example
game does have sound working. I don't
know what I am missing here.

Don't think I'll have much more time for
this during my batch though.

@08:58 I need to scrap this project, or plan a demo #tic80-voxbox
I don't think I can justify putting more time into this,
unless I can make something that is presentable.

@09:02 Hoping to get an example by end of day. #event-driven-gesture

@09:05 Publishing

@09:11 Extracting links and resources from CE's page #timelog:00:36:40

@10:04 back to this event queue #event-driven-gesture #timelog:01:26:19

@10:05 Did I rework the abstraction already? #event-driven-gesture

@10:11 Making clippy happy. #event-driven-gesture
I don't love this. This feels like busywork.

@10:16 Monowav errors with cargo clippy #event-driven-gesture
I'm crashing when I run cargo clippy. Let's make
it not crash. I can deal with the warnings later.

@10:26 Back to event queue, gotta work with other types #event-driven-gesture
Scalars are being handled, now to work with the other
types.

@10:47 I am annoyed with clippy now #event-driven-gesture
This is why nothing gets done. I've been wasting time
trying to make Clippy happy all in the name of supposedly "better"
code, and I'm almost 45 minutes with nothing to show.
---
It warps the brain, seeing all these squigglys in an editor.
Like a teacher marking up an essay in red. I don't think
it's actually possible to turn syntax off in nvim. The
usualy "syntax off" trick doesn't work.

@10:49 I think the event queue is done? #event-driven-gesture
I think it's reasonable to think about starting
the Gesture.

@10:52 Incorporating initial event queue into Gesture. #event-driven-gesture
I'm liking these incremental tests. What's a good way to
test that things are working as expected?
---
For starters, I need to be able to initialize this gesture
by pushing an initial set of events.

@11:31 got a test to pass for producing first event #event-driven-gesture

@12:00 Audio Hang

@13:33 Event driven gestures part 2 #event-driven-gesture #timelog:02:03:08

@13:41 Need to test that events change when expected #event-driven-gesture
Behavior we want: events should only be processed at the
start of a new phase.
---
Situation: I push an event A and call =preinit=. I then
push event B, after the tick is called. What is the
expected set of states for each period?
---
Pre-init sets things up so that our first period for
sure starts with A. I believe that first tick sets things
up such that the next state it is transitioning to is also A.
Either that, or it is uninitialized. Not sure. Checking.

@14:13 event queue is not working as expected #event-driven-gesture
My test is currently failing to get the next point
as expected.
---
Oh wait, it's because I'm checking the external clock's
phase changes, not the internal change.

@14:23 quick check on bbl vizzy

@14:26 Trying to see what happens when using =new_period= #event-driven-gesture

@14:36 I am using println to set up a timeline of events #event-driven-gesture
The order that things get set is very crucial. I want
to see if I am doing the timing correctly here.

@14:45 I am trying to understand the timeline #event-driven-gesture
It is eventually correct, but I have to wait about 5 samples
after the first period.
---
Before the first tick, event A is pushed, and then preinit is
called. This triggets the =next= event to happen, which
dequeues the event and sets the value.
---
At the first tick, next vertex is called immediately.
There are no values. The cached vertex is left unchanged,
so it is still A.
---
Note to self: I am using =new_period= wrong. The timeline
---
Event B is pushed as an event before the next tick.
It will not be read until the next period.
When will the next period happen? The current phasor
is currently set to have a incrementor value of 0.1, so
10 samples per period. The rate multiplier has been set
to be 2/3, which is like slowing things down by a factor of
1.5. The test *does* seem to pass after about 15 samples
through trial and error.

@14:57 I am tracking the change in phase wrong. #event-driven-gesture
I need keep track of the interal rephasored value and watch
for new periods there.
---
Works!

@15:06 Now, onto waits #event-driven-gesture
Wait are events that tell the clock to wait some number
of periods before processing the next events in the queue.
---
A wait time of 1 will wait one whole period before allowing
further events in the queue to be processed. 
---
If I push a wait of 1, and then a scalar in the middle of
period A, the start of the next period, B will dequeue
the wait, and then suspend reading other events. At
the next period C, there will no longer be a wait, and
the next value will be set.

@15:47 Tests have been made. They fail. Now to implement it. #event-driven-gesture

@15:53 Wait implemented, tests pass. #event-driven-gesture

@16:02 Shelving tic80 voxbox demo for now #tic80-voxbox
This feels like a dead-end at the moment. Maybe if there
was already an existing following of tic80 peeps who
were adventerous to make their own builds. BUT, this
is not the case right now.
---
I'm sticking to shareable presentations that work on
the web. Unfortunately, the wasm is pre-built so there
is no great way to hack audio into this.
---
I honestly don't have any meaningful things to do with this
new hack I did. It serves no other purpose than "oh, I did
it". It's not enough.

@16:06 Attempting to implement connect #dagzet-rust #timelog:01:07:59
Connect adds a pair of edges to the graph.
---
These are set to be local connections. ID values
work just fine here.
---
I'm curious about knowing how I did cx? Was that
another structure? Am I checking cycles there?
---
cx is another structure and loops/cycles are not=
being checked for.

@16:37 I think connections don't check for existing nodes until the end? #dagzet-rust
My original dagzet implementation reperesents the
dagzet connections as strings that are only checked
at the end of parsing when all the nodes have been
added. Only then does it attempt to resolve
the symbols. This makes for a more permissive
parser.
---
My dagzet parser does the topological sort with
the strings. I think it would be better to resolve
those chunks into local ID values before the sort.

@17:09 Connections work, but unverified #dagzet-rust
This is intentional. Verifications are defferred until
everything is parsed. Verification is beyond the
responsibility of connection.
---
There is a linear check for already existing
connections, and a test is put into place
to make sure this is all properly caught.

@17:13 Shortcuts are not yet supported in co #dagzet-rust
Adding TODOs for that.
---
I've implemented enough today.

@19:22 Reading #read-elem-compsys #timelog:01:08:49
Finished up reading last bits in chapter 1. Read chapter
2 (shorter) on Boolean Arithmetic and their ALU.
---
I have not done any of the projects yet. I am hoping
this can be one of those things I can return back to
when I have a chunk of time available.
---
I want to believe that "just reading" without doing
projects is "not nothing, not everything". That is to say,
I hope I'm getting something worthwhile from this.
