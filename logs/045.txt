@07:59 Adding some words to landing page

@08:00 Morning triage.

@08:08 I want to build some jitter constructs today #create-chatter-sounds

The first will be a randi like module clocked with
an external phasor. The second will be a phasor
whose rate can be randomized every period. Together,
they can build a pretty decent jitter signal.

I'll probably be extracting my LCG logic into
an RNG module as well.

@08:10 Going to tackle this this morning #add-demos-page

@08:11 Ordered lists in dagzet needed for resume #resume-setup #dagzet-lists
I know, I know, I'm overengineering this.

@08:17 Kickstart: way to set up neovim with LSP? #investigate-kickstart-neovim

Dan mentioned using VSCode again, and I'm inclined to
take his advice. However, before I try that, I want
to see if I can get some decent LSP things working
with NeoVim. Would be especially helpful if I
can get it running on this Alpine thinkpad.

Found Kickstart while trying to google "typescript in
neovim". This was the other thing mentioned too:
[[https://github.com/pmizio/typescript-tools.nvim]].

@08:21 Getting ready to publish.
