@2024-07-30 Day 72. Trio Initial Web Port made
10 days left of batch
---
Prev: attempts to port to web, some more chord manager
ideas.
---
Next: @!(taskref "demo-trio-web")!@: Get an initial
prototype working, basically.

@07:50 Morning Triage

@08:01 Just do the graphics in canvas instead of p5? #demo-trio-web
R mentioned this, and it's been a sentiment that others
have mentioned as well. p5 just makes canvas calls
anyways.

@08:06 Publish.

@08:07 Get something working using canvas API #demo-trio-web #timelog:01:34:07

@08:56 Trying to get pointer logic working. #demo-trio-web
Following @!(dzref "webdev/using_pointer_events")!@.
---
Issue was a chrome mobile related issue. Had to use
CSS to set =touch-actions= to be =none=.

@09:35 Setting up dynamic lines layout #demo-trio-web

@09:43 Okay visuals are off to a good start now. #demo-trio-web

@09:48 Begin work making audioworklet stuff #demo-trio-web #timelog:01:02:25
Once again...

@09:50 turning things into a module #demo-trio-web
Interesting, the parser becomes stricter. I need
to formally declare "i" in my for loop. All done
by simply add "type=module" to my HTML script element.

@10:13 click to start mechanics not behaving for some reason #demo-trio-web
Figured it out: it was the callback mechanics of
requestAnimationFrame.

@10:16 adding "TAP TO BEGIN" text. #demo-trio-web

@10:27 setting up message passing to worklet #demo-trio-web

@10:30 first getting the input events to the node #demo-trio-web

@10:38 startAudio returns a promise I guess? #demo-trio-web
Solution: encapsulate in =then=.

@10:43 move message works! #demo-trio-web

@10:47 send to processor via messages now #demo-trio-web

@10:51 initial message passing implemented #demo-trio-web
I'll have to do the rest later.

@12:00 Audio Hang

@13:17 More audioworklet stuff #demo-trio-web #timelog:02:51:07

@13:21 Why is gate not being read in chromium #demo-trio-web
I'm mouse events are happening either way
---
Logic bug. And should have been an or. Struggled to clear
cache on Chromium too.

@13:27 Get wasm stuff working #demo-trio-web

@13:29 My println stuff is causing issues I think. #demo-trio-web
I'm not going to do macros, I'm just going to comment
things out.

@13:37 Huh. it's not generating a wasm at all actually, even though there is no error. #demo-trio-web
Had to generate cdylib.

@13:43 More unknown opcodes in wasm-gc. I wonder if there's a way to get more info on that #demo-trio-web
It went from unknown opcode 192 to 193, after I commented
out all the panics.

@13:50 broke the tests last night with more notes I think #demo-trio-web
Nope, that wasn't it. Sigh. Gotta bisect.
---
Bisect tracked down the quick bugfix I made that checked
for valid lower/upper values.

@14:21 A messy fix for now, but things don't panic and tests pass #demo-trio-web

@14:27 A very odd opcode was generated in wasm #demo-trio-web
Opcode 193 is something that extends a signed opcode, which
caused wasm-gc to panic. The lines that do that are in
the =measure_movement= function. It was quick to find because
it's the only time I deliberately cast from unsigned to
signed. I happened to use i16 which caused the panic to
happen. However, changing to i32 made things work just fine.

@14:31 right. Now I need to get the wasm in. #demo-trio-web
The exports and the interface are already there from the
C prototype. It should mostly drop right in.

@15:00 There should be sound. But there is no sound. #demo-trio-web

@15:25 Still not sure where there isn't sound. #demo-trio-web

@15:28 I forgot to return true, but there still ain't any sound. #demo-trio-web

@15:46 Okay, now there's sound. #demo-trio-web
I wasn't passing in the dsp parameter.

@15:47 Attempting to run on phone. #demo-trio-web

@16:11 Good enough. Taking a break. #demo-trio-web

@19:30 Back to the hub. Didn't actually get anything planned done.
I did, however, manage to get jackdaw running on my
computer @!(dzref "misc/jackdaw")!@. I was very impressed
with project, and didn't realize just how much tooling
was built for it. Things like a layout editor, a YAML parser,
and an XMl parser.

The audio devices weren't querying correctly on my computer,
and we discovered that it was most likely a problem with
SDL on my computer.
