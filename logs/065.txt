@2024-07-23 Day 65.
17 days left of batch.

Prev: Work on new voice scheduling system for
Trio. File range command in Dagzet. I got to
play with this really cool haptic knob controller
(NANO-D evaluation kit)?
---
Next:

|| @!(taskref "dagzet-rust")!@: Finish up file range,
and work on the other remaining commands.

|| @!(taskref "demo-trio-voice-scheduler")!@: Continue
implementing triggers for specific events with tests.

@08:38 Morning triage.

@08:39 Clearly not getting around to this #LC75
I am putting it in "main" instead of priority.
---
Let me get these last few projects in a good
place (@!(taskref "demo-trio)!@ and @!(taskref
"dagzet-rust")!@), and then I'll try to find
time to start this?
---
I know, I know. I'm putting it off.

@08:56 getting ready to fix merge conflicts.

@09:07 Publishing
