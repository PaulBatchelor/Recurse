@2024-07-23 Day 65.
17 days left of batch.
---
Prev: Work on new voice scheduling system for
Trio. File range command in Dagzet. I got to
play with this really cool haptic knob controller
(NANO-D evaluation kit)?
---
Next:

|| @!(taskref "dagzet-rust")!@: Finish up file range,
and work on the other remaining commands.

|| @!(taskref "demo-trio-voice-scheduler")!@: Continue
implementing triggers for specific events with tests.

@08:38 Morning triage.

@08:39 Clearly not getting around to this #LC75
I am putting it in "main" instead of priority.
---
Let me get these last few projects in a good
place (@!(taskref "demo-trio)!@ and @!(taskref
"dagzet-rust")!@), and then I'll try to find
time to start this?
---
I know, I know. I'm putting it off.

@08:56 getting ready to fix merge conflicts.

@09:07 Publishing

@09:20 Actually, before publishing, fix compeng page

@09:25 fixed logdb generator bottleneck
Classic mistake: forgot to add BEGIN/COMMIT

@09:31 file range table generation #dagzet-rust #timelog:00:07:14

@09:39 Off to implement hyperlinks #dagzet-rust #timelog:00:37:18

@10:16 TODO task #dagzet-rust #timelog:00:13:18

@10:30 Tags (tg) #dagzet-rust #timelog:00:31:30
This one is slightly more interesting because of
how the data is represented in SQLite vs how
it's entered in dagzet. From a dagzet point of
view, tags are a list of entries associated with
a node. In SQLite, they boil down into pairs.
---
Tags should be able to be called more than once.
---
I think I'm only going to have time for the initial
test before I break for lunch. Maybe.

@11:01 Test is breaking in a weird way. #dagzet-rust
I'm not sure why it's not getting the correct
number of tags? Oh well, will have to look at it
later.

@12:21 What is going on what this test #dagzet-rust #timelog:00:31:14
I was misinterpretting the boolean result of the hashset
insert method. Negating that fixed stuff.
---
tags finished.

@12:53 Attempts to move test to another place #dagzet-rust #timelog:00:08:11
I think for the most part these could be thought of
as integration tests.
---
Nevermind. I just won't fight it right now.

@13:03 Select node command is last on my list I think #dagzet-rust #timelog:00:12:18
