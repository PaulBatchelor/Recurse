@2024-06-28 Day 40. Missing nodes. HTML/WASM export in tic80.
42 days left of batch.

@07:28 Get Sokol example working on new laptop #investigate-tic80
Precursor to getting tic-80 working.
Oh wow that was easy. Little did I know I was 30 seconds
away from getting this working last night.

@07:30 Back to tic-80 compilation on new laptop #investigate-tic80
Now that sokol example works, I think I figured out
all the graphics issues

@07:36 TIC-80 builds, runs tetris, no sound yet #investigate-tic80

@07:47 Sound works. Studying music demo. #investigate-tic80
I like the scale and form factor of this.

@08:08 trying to see where export is hanging #investigate-tic80

@08:12 tried running in gdb and gdb crashed. musl issues? #investigate-tic80

@08:44 tic80 export works on mac #investigate-tic80
The bundle includes the tic80 card and a wasm file. I
have no idea where the wasm comes from. It's not a file
included in the source, and there doesn't seem to be
any clear indication where/how it is being generated. My
best guess is that somewhere it gets made with emscripten
because I see mentions of it when I grep for wasm-y things.

@09:39 At the hub.

@09:40 Back to investigating missing nodes #bug-missing-nodes #timelog:01:25:41

@09:41 Oh crap the ulitimate spinner is available
I missed my chance months ago (waited months
for this). Can't afford it. Oh well. Still
buying.

@09:52 =generate_graph_data.lua= and =genpage.lua= #bug-missing-nodes
These are the missing files

@09:55 Run =dz_wikigen.sh= to trigger debug message #bug-missing-nodes

@09:57 The nodelist is not being created correctly. why? #bug-missing-nodes

@10:00 genpage.pagedata: output nodes being made via params.nodelist #bug-missing-nodes
How is this being created?

@10:00 Lua issues, debug flag is not working #bug-missing-nodes

@10:12 Lua function setting the global variable sets it to true somehow? #bug-missing-nodes

@10:13 Oh wait, I was setting this #bug-missing-nodes

@10:18 okay weird. the debug flag is being unset somewhere apparently #bug-missing-nodes
Not the problem I wanted to troubleshoot, but hey I need
this for the visibility.

@10:22 more testing for visibility with traverse_node() #bug-missing-nodes
The debug mode flag is never set to true here. Confirmed
with printing and filtering output.
---
Also confirmed that it doesn't matter if you're using the
function =dbg= I made or checking the variable itself. It's
the same. So, I'm pretty sure the =dbg= shortcut function is
fine.
---
I need to be able to track down when this is being set,
and then unset.

@10:29 the debug flag is definitely being set exactly once #bug-missing-nodes
I think what's happening is the variable is being copied over
when it is loaded up in the module. Hoping to fix this by
using a big global that can be read everywhere.

@10:35 Okay, global debug flag didn't work. Rethinking approach #bug-missing-nodes
This is NOT what I'm debugging. I just need visibility.

@10:39 Crap. I was setting the debug flag too late. Oh well. #bug-missing-nodes
I have a clumsier approach now, but it works, and I've wasted
too much time chasing this pre-bug to improve it.

@10:42 Missing node names show up in input node list supplied to genpage #bug-missing-nodes
Confirmed that the nodes do come up, but they aren't being
traversed for whatever reason.

@10:44 Do missing nodes show up in topsort? #bug-missing-nodes

@10:48 Topsort isn't returning enough nodes. Why? #bug-missing-nodes
should be 33, but I'm getting 20.

@11:17 Let's find ou the missing nodes #bug-missing-nodes
I tried looking for something to make sense in the code,
but I can't yet see a pattern for what is there and
what isn't there.

@11:21 Missing nodes seem to line up with the missing nodes on page #bug-missing-nodes
Clocking out for now

@13:34 Troubleshooting tic80 export on thinkpad #investigate-tic80 #timelog:00:44:37

@13:42 onExportHTML call seems to return hmmm #investigate-tic80
printf-ing to console works, even if gdb crashes

@13:45 =tic_net_get()=: that doesn't sound great #investigate-tic80
Sounds like it might be trying to download something from
the internet? Yeah, that could be a problem here.

@13:51 =tic_net_get()= might not be getting called #investigate-tic80
Firslty, the printf I placed there isn't showing up.
Secondly, it makes a call to =empscripten_fetch=, which
I do not (think I) have.
---
Maybe it is defined elsewhere?
---
Ah, there are multiple definitions here. Wonder which
one is the actual one.

@13:57 =tic_net_get()= is an empty function. #investigate-tic80
The tic cart loaders are pre-compiled wasm files.
The path is =/export/1.2-dev/html=.

@14:08 The tic cart loader, as far as I can tell, is closed source. #investigate-tic80
Basically, HTML export works by fetching from a URL. This
downloads a zipfile that already has the wasm in there.
Exporting is simply a matter of dropping that TIC file
in the in the zip file.

@14:11 Options moving forward #investigate-tic80
So, it's looking like doing any kind of hacking on this
would be a fairly ambitious task that would take up most
of my time. It looks like this wasm file is the only thing
I have. What I'd like to do is to somehow patch it,
potentially. And get it to load in custom code for audio
playback.
---
It's not a no, though it would dramatically change what it
is I came here to do. Instead of doing funny vocal synth
stuff, I'd be going deep into trying to reverse engineer
this thing. Feels very much in the spirit of RC. And this
is more motivating to me than more frontend-y stuff. There
may be less polished things to show, though.

@14:21 Looking into wasm2wat #investigate-wabt #timelog:00:22:34
Needed for reverse engineering tic80 wasm bundle.
---
I love how easy it was to build, and the tools look
very neat.

@14:45 thoughts on reverse engineering tic80 #investigate-tic80
Using
this to make any sense of tic80 feels like something
that would take me maybe months to a year to do maybe.
Hacking the tic80 source code itself would take
less time. I'd probably have better luck building
my own cartridge loader.
---
I think if I wanted to go deep on wasm rather
than frontend stacks, I'd definitely want to look
into this. This stuff sparks joy more than
javascript/React.

@14:46 how is a tic cart saved? #investigate-tic80 #timelog:00:22:00
I am pretty sure it's lua5.3, based on grepping for
version for the built in luajit.
---
Functions defined in =cart.c=. Looking at =music.tic=, the
code for the seems to be at the very bottom.

@16:48 The Big Plans #what-now-week6 #timelog:00:26:42
Ink on paper.

@17:20 some triage and organizing

@17:23 Friday concluding thoughts #what-now-week6 #timelog:00:27:00
I want to focus on designing more musical experiences
using my vocal synthesizer, that run in the browser.
---
This, however, is not enough of a project, and
risks being too design oriented rather than technically
oriented. I am also quite seriously considering putting
some work into hacking my vocal synthesis DSP written
in Rust into tic80.
---
Why tic80? I like the aesthetic. And hacking the
software's source code seems to very much be in the
spirit of RC. It is also possible to export to WASM,
but not with the hacks. As a stretch, it may be
possible to somehow hack the wasm TIC cartridge
wasm blob, or even write a custom TIC loader based
on the TIC-80 codebase.
---
Design and presentation is still and important
factor. There will be two kinds musical interactions:
ensemble and solo. The main ensemble sining project will
probably be something similar to blob opera. The
main solo singing project will be "A Blob Named Bucket",
a chittering singinig virtual pet that you have to
coax out of hiding with food.
---
A Blob Named Bucket will be the more complicated project,
requiring a procedurally generated critter generator,
and a character engine simulator Bucket's behavior.
For this reason, these components will be broken up
into smaller self-contained demos. These need to
be self contained because it's likely I may not
be able to get to the final project.
---
The ensemble demo will probably just be for the web
using p5, and will building off of the chords
demo I made in the first half.
---
TIC-80 demos will do their best to follow some
of the ideas in the p5 demos. Could be thought
of as "redux" versions? I want to do my best to
refine the mechanics of these demos, reduce
until they are distilled into simple elegant
forms of sonic interaction.
---
Tooling will need to be made as well. These
will probably be HTML/WASM, and for practice,
I will use React for these.

@17:38 Careers strategy #what-now-week6 #what-now-week7
I did not think about this too hard for this.
That's what next week can be for?

@17:40 End of planning in week6 #what-now-week6
