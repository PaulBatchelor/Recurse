@2024-08-02 Day 75.
7 days left of batch.

@08:30 Play piano

@09:00 Chats at Table

@09:27 Catching up on logs

@09:34 I want to try a mini bucket named blob #demo-blob #blob-coax
So, poke is really bumming me out. It's too much abuse.
---
Using no sound, just circles, to try out this initial
idea.
---
There is a big white circle on the page. You click
to place other smaller black circles (pellets). The
circle waits, then moves to each circle to "eat" them,
then repeats the process until there aren't any other
circles.

@10:09 retrospection #demo-poke
Yesterday I showed another person my Poke demo [0]. Another 
very visceral response: "why did you make me do that to 
him?"
---
On the one hand, I guess I should be pleased that I am 
getting strong reactions to my art. On the other hand, no, 
not like this :(
---
I find myself agreeing with the reactions. It's very hard 
to make the "poke" action feel consensual. Even a "tickle" 
is an invasion. I wanted to build something whimsical, but 
I didn't really consider the implications of the mechanic. 
No matter how cute or whimsical the design is, the poke 
negates all of this.
---
I feel a little more deflated than usual about this. With 
"Poke", it sometimes feels like I've accidentally added a 
bit more cruelty in the world, which was the exact opposite 
of my intention.

@11:05 Finally publishing.

@12:45 Inking out some ideas. #demo-coax #timelog:00:22:24

@13:19 Attempts to code up the ideas in Canvas #demo-coax #timelog:02:27:57

@13:35 We have a circle. #demo-coax

But, weird stroke bug in firefox. The line has
variable thickness, and some dots. In chromium,
this is a non-issue.

@14:10 Trying to get an initial journey mechanic working #demo-coax

@14:16 trying to get a constant velocity now #demo-coax
Somehow need to convert times to be pixels per second.

@14:30 Inking some ideas #demo-coax

@14:44 Attempting to implement those ideas #demo-coax

@14:55 I might not need trig actually #demo-coax
It's traveling on a line, so maybe just the line equation.
It can be a normalized slope velocity too. Something to
add to a point until it reaches a target.

@15:01 I'd like to add different movement behaviors #demo-coax
So, calculate progress, and then use an easing function
to make it so it can slow down or speed up to a target.

@15:13 behavior... kind of? #demo-coax
It's not quit what I wanted it be. I'd need to rework
it to make it work with easings. The current implementation
just calculates an relative trajectory, and I'm adjusting
how fast that trajectory goes based on the position.
interpolating between two points would be better.

@15:46 I got behaviors the way I want now #demo-coax
Behaviors now have different interpolation schemes.
They are also randomized now, and can have randomized 
speeds.

@18:18 Insert more pellets, eat pellets #demo-coax #timelog:00:36:16

@18:47 Now to add a wait timer #demo-coax

@18:56 Blob should get bigger everytime there are pellets #demo-coax
When they get too big, there should be a forced pause, and
the Blob should shrink again.

@19:23 If pellets aren't around for a while, digest #demo-coax

@19:30 It should begin jiggling at the larger scales #demo-coax
Like it's about to burst.
