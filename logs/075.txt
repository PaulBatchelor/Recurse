@09:27 Catching up on logs

@09:34 I want to try a mini bucket named blob #demo-blob #blob-coax
So, poke is really bumming me out. It's too much abuse.
---
Using no sound, just circles, to try out this initial
idea.
---
There is a big white circle on the page. You click
to place other smaller black circles (pellets). The
circle waits, then moves to each circle to "eat" them,
then repeats the process until there aren't any other
circles.

@10:09 retrospection #demo-poke
Yesterday I showed another person my Poke demo [0]. Another 
very visceral response: "why did you make me do that to 
him?"
---
On the one hand, I guess I should be pleased that I am 
getting strong reactions to my art. On the other hand, no, 
not like this :(
---
I find myself agreeing with the reactions. It's very hard 
to make the "poke" action feel consensual. Even a "tickle" 
is an invasion. I wanted to build something whimsical, but 
I didn't really consider the implications of the mechanic. 
No matter how cute or whimsical the design is, the poke 
negates all of this.
---
I feel a little more deflated than usual about this. With 
"Poke", it sometimes feels like I've accidentally added a 
bit more cruelty in the world, which was the exact opposite 
of my intention.

@11:05 Finally publishing.

@12:45 Inking out some ideas. #demo-coax #timelog:00:22:24

@13:19 Attempts to code up the ideas in Canvas #demo-coax

@13:35 We have a circle. #demo-coax

But, weird stroke bug in firefox. The line has
variable thickness, and some dots. In chromium,
this is a non-issue.

@14:10 Trying to get an initial journey mechanic working #demo-coax

@14:16 trying to get a constant velocity now #demo-coax
Somehow need to convert times to be pixels per second.

@14:30 Inking some ideas #demo-coax

@14:44 Attempting to implement those ideas #demo-coax
