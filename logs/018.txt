Next: game jam wrap-up. back to implementing velum. thoughts
on preset export.

@09:34 Morning triage.

@09:38 Basically completed with game-jam related things #game-jam
I think I've wrapped up most of my contributions to the
game jam. I don't think I can afford to do much more.

@10:06 Finished triage, about to make a check-in.

@10:27 Where did I leave off with velum #implement-velum

@10:34 Nap

@11:05 Try to add some scaffolding #implement-velum

@11:09 Actually realizing that "nose" is a better name #implement-velum
"Velum" refers to the membrane separating the oral
cavity (mouth) from the nasal cavity (nose). The nose is
another waveguide. The velum is just a value that controls
the opening of this waveguide.

@11:29 Some initial scaffolding and comments. #implement-velum
I think I understand enough to start coding some things up.

@11:30 Getting ready to go to Hub
@12:00 Pairing and level tweaks, game testing  #game-jam
@13:00 Lunch
@14:02 Back at home, coding up some nose/velum stuff. #implement-velum
@14:34 Back to Hub
