@2024-06-03 Day 15. (Ooops I forgot it was game jam day)
This weekend, I moved into the apartment that
I will be staying in for the remainder of my batch. Will
probably have earlier hours now.
---
prev: Made my first interactive singing synthesis demo
for the web! See [[https://pbat.ch/recurse/demos/singer_test]].
---
next: velum, presets for interactive demo,
tasks page, C Creatures, more project scoping
for voxbox.
@08:00 Morning Triage.
@08:18 creating some voxbox tasks
@08:24 tasks directory work #create-tasks-directory
@08:47 adding task descriptions #html-task-descriptions
@08:59 Write-up for zulip checkin.
@09:20 Getting ready to leave for RC
@09:54 velum initial setup #implement-velum
Velum is not implemented in tubular @!(dzref
"voxbox/tubular")!@, but it is in implemented in
tract @!(dzref "voxbox/tract")!@. Getting
tract code tangled and re-examine what needs to be added.

@10:12 core issue: how to set size of nose procedurally #implement-velum
The original tract waveguide had a fixed size of 28, which should
be a size in CM (which will most likely be expressed as
proptional percentage of the tract width in practice).

@10:18 figure out current size of nose in CM #implement-velum
The harddcoded size is 28, which I believe is 2x oversampled,
so that's 14 samples.
---
Looks like it is around 10-12cm:
---
To derive, I opened the equation I was using to convert
tract len (cm) to samples in bc:

===
#+BEGIN_SRC bc
(len * 0.01)/(speed_of_sound / sr)
#+END_SRC

or

#+BEGIN_SRC bc
(16 * 0.01)/(343.0 / 44100.0)
#+END_SRC
===

I changed the length until the result was around 14
samples, so 11cm seems to be about right.

@10:33 some boilerplate

@10:45 (approx) gamejam planning with JZ
@12:00 gamejam kickoff (put velum on hold) #game-jam #implement-velum
I forgot this week was the game jam. My velum work will have
to wait a few days.
