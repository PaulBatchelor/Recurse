into knowledge graph.

|| @!(taskref "dagzet-rust")!@ Try to get to this today?

|| @!(taskref "tic80-sine-tone")!@: timebox this today,
see if I can make more progress.

|| @!(taskref "dmeo-trio")!@: initial code, get chords
working.

@08:13 Morning triage.

@08:14 Did not get to this yesterday. Today maybe? #dagzet-rust

@08:44 I think I nerfed the experience with quantization #drawing-tablet-demo
I think I might have nerfed the experience
with the pitch quanitization to be honest. It
seems like the people I showed the quantized
version to used it for less time compared to
when it was "fretless". People really enjoyed
the fluidic expressiveness of the pitch control
and getting it to emote things using just
inflection. Food for thought for another demo?

@08:55 This would be a good weekend project #add-day-titles

@08:56 I have still not started this. Sigh. #LC75

@08:57 Don't know if this is worth my time to actually read right now #react-escape-hatches

@08:58 This concept feels pretty fleshed out #concept-concerto #demo-trio
I think I might call it "trio", and the elevator pitch
is that you control one voice in a trio, and there
is an algorithm that controls the other two pitches
to form 3 part harmony.
