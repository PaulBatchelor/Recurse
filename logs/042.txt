@09:43 Morning Triage.

@09:50 Sunsetting morning triage task #morning-triage
I initially was going to time my morning
triage stuff. But I don't think I want to do that.
---
Also, comments on the triage itself aren't all too
helpful. I'd much rather comment on tasks themselves

@09:52 core mechanic for this shouldn't be too hard #voxbox-shape-morphing

@09:58 webaudio is broken on firefox thinkpad. #troubleshoot-webaudio-thinkpad
Sounds do work on youtube, so I am getting browser sound.
No clues in console. Locally hosted versions do not
work either.

@10:02 Uploading and posting to zulip
Ah, still running into issues with uploading.
I didn't finish setting things up.
---
Ooops I just blew up my recurse site. ROLL BAAACK.

@10:11 Oh god it's all broken. starting a new task. #site-debugging-jun30
Seeing what I can accomplish in 15 minutes, then
I have to quickly leave for errands.

@10:15 Ooops forgot to install rsync. #site-debugging-jun30 #timelog:00:20:00

@10:16 codestudy is getting errors in export #site-debugging-jun30
Looks like the escape string is wrong. I am using
"'" instead of """. I did this to myself when I was
trying to update the SQLite generator scripts (they
got stricter about single vs double qoute usage apparently.
Technically, you're supposed to use single quotes only,
but they used to allow both interchangeably).

@10:23 I deleted some tasks #site-debugging-jun30
I think this is fine actually? Looking at them,
it seems like I meant to delete them. I was
worried that I accidentally deleted the tasks
or something.

@10:35 Errands

@10:51 I found a Haiku during my errands
I've just decided to start doing my daily check-ins
as Haikus, so I was destined to find this today.
It was printed on a wall of a builing. A haiku
by Richard Wright.

@11:36 Back at Hub. Setting up.

@11:37 Initial voxbox-ing setup #voxbox-shape-morphing

@11:39 Oh, right. I need to build mplayer form source #voxbox-shape-morphing #mplayer-jack-thinkpad
This thinkpad isn't fully provisioned yet. Upstream
mplayer doesn't have jack support, so I need to
build it from source.
---
I remember this taking a while. Uh, maybe I should look
at other things.
---
Nevermind? It just finsihed as I wrote this. That's
not a great sign.
---
Ran into build issues. Great. Downloading from git,
using the APKBUILD as hints.
---
MPlayer is kinda SVN? But this build script is
using git?

@11:40 Attempts to get mplayer working on thinkpad begins. #mplayer-jack-thinkpad #timelog:00:48:13

@12:01 Going to try building the package instead of source. #mplayer-jack-thinkpad
Not what I wanted to do, but here we are.
---
Bandwidth is slow even at the hub. git feels slow too.
I wonder how much faster it'd be on a newer laptop.

@12:09 going to attempt to get abuild to run #mplayer-jack-thinkpad

@12:19 It builds! But I wasn't sure how to install it #mplayer-jack-thinkpad
Build time wasn't too bad, so I'm rebuilding.

@12:20 Where is "pkgdir"? #mplayer-jack-thinkpad
Package installed in =packages/community/x86_64=.

@12:24 attempting to install manually #mplayer-jack-thinkpad
Can be done with =apk add foo.apk=. I don't think I needed
the =--allow-untrusted= flag because it was self-signed.

@12:26 works! #mplayer-jack-thinkpad
I love how straightforward that was.

@13:35 Back at the hub. Thinking about what to do next.

@13:39 Made a formal task for slider #typescript-react-slider
I created the project with this
command: @!(dzref "webdev/npx_create_react_app_typescript")!@.

@13:41 Time to think about resume this week #what-now-week7 #resume-setup

@13:51 Finally getting around to implementing initial shape morphing #voxbox-shape-morphing #timelog:00:09:00
I think...

@13:58 This isn't going to work the way I thought, and I'm happy about that. #voxbox-shape-morphing
Initially I was going to add a small method to the tract
that linearly interpolates two DRM tract shapes, given a
position. BUT, the DRM shapes aren't in there. So,
I actually have to plan out a new interface.

@14:00 Working out interface (ink and paper) #voxbox-shape-morphing #timelog:00:14:34

@14:35 Making a cooler looking lock screen for swaylock

@14:48 Re-examining GSG code. Generics possible? #voxbox-shape-morphing #timelog:00:25:03
Basically, I want to generalize the values that can be
interpolated. It is currently set to be 32-bit floats,
BUT, it'd be nice to make them generics. That way, the shape
morphing can work on those generics.

@15:01 some initial refactoring completed #voxbox-shape-morphing
The core Gesture and GestureVertex structs take in generic
arguments, with the rest hardcoded to take in f32. This was
much less friction than I expected.
---
Next steps: have the linear gesture signal generator take
in generics as well. After that, the generics can be
refit to take in shapes. Somehow. (Indices? references?)

@15:40 attempts to look at this typescript sample code #typescript-react-slider #timelog:00:54:42
Does it look like the other react code I've been examining?

@17:15 React Reading: Sharing State Between Components #react-managing-state #timelog:00:24:29

@18:17 Another session of troubleshooting #bug-missing-nodes #timelog:00:51:53

@18:24 Ah, the node IDs changed I think. good for me. #bug-missing-nodes
Actually not too much of an issue, I have enough
printing happening now that I can update when/if
needed.

@18:29 Examining all the connections now #bug-missing-nodes
The =magsign_cpp= is what we are investigating. What
would need to happen for it to not show up in =cpp=?

@18:33 =magsign_struct= is the only child that doesn't exist #bug-missing-nodes
Not sure if that is helpful or not.
---
Of the three, It's also the only one that only shows
up once as a left-node (it only has
one parent node). That parent is =magsign_cpp=.

@18:39 It's probably the external nodes. #bug-missing-nodes
As we go down this tree, we are approaching the only
two external nodes here: =rust/std= and
=rust/std_iter_zip=. The TOC generates the links
just fine, but it just seems like anything that has
those links doesn't want to show up.

@18:40 Also, edges for those external are returning NULL. #bug-missing-nodes
What's up with that?

@18:41 commenting out the external nodes, I want to see what happens.

@18:43 People of Earth, we have our smoking gun. #bug-missing-nodes
Removing those external nodes causes it to render
properly.

@18:47 Working out another hunch #bug-missing-nodes
I don't think the edges are supposed to be nil, even
though they are here.
---
I have another hunch: there is a local node called
"rust", and the namespace for these external nodes
also starts with "rust". Going to re-introduce the
external nodes, and change the local "rust" node
to be "rust_code", and then if that still breaks,
"code_rust". It could be that there is some faulty
logic related to string matching somewhere.
---
Neither worked. Okay, so I have to check
out those nil edges now.

@18:51 Tracking down those nil edges. #bug-missing-nodes

@19:00 I think I did it. #bug-missing-nodes
While populating a local copy of
the edges table (to be pruned later by the topsort
algo), I added a check to see if the left node
id shows up in the nodes list. If it doesn't, it
indicates that it is an externally linked node
outside of the namespace.
---
TL;DR: Check for foreign nodes.

@19:04 cleanup debug code #bug-missing node

@19:37 refactor linear gesture to take in generics #voxbox-shape-morphing #timelog:00:21:41
Okay that didn't work.

@19:49 stop writing code, think about the problem. Why generics? #voxbox-shape-morphing
This gesture is currently hard-coded to work with
floats as values. Which, most of the time, is fine.
However, for shape morphing, the values that
need to be interpolated aren't floating point values,
but tables.
---
The hope with generics was to be able to elegantly
use the existing linear gesture logic to create
gestures that morphed between DRM shapes.
---
Things would be set up in such a way that when
=tick()= would be called, it would know to
interplate between two DRM tables and store it
somewhere in another table. That table could
then be taken and passed to the vocal tract.
---
Stopping for now because I've had enough of a day.
