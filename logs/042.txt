|| @!(taskref "voxbox-shape-morphing")!@: set up initial
mechanics for morphing shapes in voxbox.

out why sounds aren't playing in the browser on my
thinkpad.

@09:43 Morning Triage.

@09:50 Sunsetting morning triage task #morning-triage
I initially was going to time my morning
triage stuff. But I don't think I want to do that.
---
Also, comments on the triage itself aren't all too
helpful. I'd much rather comment on tasks themselves

@09:52 core mechanic for this shouldn't be too hard #voxbox-shape-morphing

@09:58 webaudio is broken on firefox thinkpad. #troubleshoot-webaudio-thinkpad
Sounds do work on youtube, so I am getting browser sound.
No clues in console. Locally hosted versions do not
work either.

@10:02 Uploading and posting to zulip
Ah, still running into issues with uploading.
I didn't finish setting things up.
---
Ooops I just blew up my recurse site. ROLL BAAACK.

@10:11 Oh god it's all broken. starting a new task. #site-debugging-jun30
Seeing what I can accomplish in 15 minutes, then
I have to quickly leave for errands.

@10:15 Ooops forgot to install rsync. #site-debugging-jun30

@10:16 codestudy is getting errors in export #site-debugging-jun30
Looks like the escape string is wrong. I am using
"'" instead of """. I did this to myself when I was
trying to update the SQLite generator scripts (they
got stricter about single vs double qoute usage apparently.
Technically, you're supposed to use single quotes only,
but they used to allow both interchangeably).

@10:23 I deleted some tasks #site-debugging-jun30
I think this is fine actually? Looking at them,
it seems like I meant to delete them. I was
worried that I accidentally deleted the tasks
or something.
