Next:

|| @!(taskref "voxbox-shape-morphing")!@: set up initial
mechanics for morphing shapes in voxbox.


|| @!(taskref "troubleshoot-webaudio-thinkpad")!@: Figure
out why sounds aren't playing in the browser on my
thinkpad.

@09:43 Morning Triage.

@09:50 Sunsetting morning triage task #morning-triage
I initially was going to time my morning
triage stuff. But I don't think I want to do that.
---
Also, comments on the triage itself aren't all too
helpful. I'd much rather comment on tasks themselves

@09:52 core mechanic for this shouldn't be too hard #voxbox-shape-morphing

@09:58 webaudio is broken on firefox thinkpad. #troubleshoot-webaudio-thinkpad
Sounds do work on youtube, so I am getting browser sound.
No clues in console. Locally hosted versions do not
work either.

@10:02 Uploading and posting to zulip
Ah, still running into issues with uploading.
I didn't finish setting things up.
---
Ooops I just blew up my recurse site. ROLL BAAACK.

@10:11 Oh god it's all broken. starting a new task. #site-debugging-jun30
Seeing what I can accomplish in 15 minutes, then
I have to quickly leave for errands.

@10:15 Ooops forgot to install rsync. #site-debugging-jun30 #timelog:00:20:00

@10:16 codestudy is getting errors in export #site-debugging-jun30
Looks like the escape string is wrong. I am using
"'" instead of """. I did this to myself when I was
trying to update the SQLite generator scripts (they
got stricter about single vs double qoute usage apparently.
Technically, you're supposed to use single quotes only,
but they used to allow both interchangeably).

@10:23 I deleted some tasks #site-debugging-jun30
I think this is fine actually? Looking at them,
it seems like I meant to delete them. I was
worried that I accidentally deleted the tasks
or something.

@10:35 Errands

@11:36 Back at Hub. Setting up.

@11:37 Initial voxbox-ing setup #voxbox-shape-morphing

@11:39 Oh, right. I need to build mplayer form source #voxbox-shape-morphing #mplayer-jack-thinkpad
This thinkpad isn't fully provisioned yet. Upstream
mplayer doesn't have jack support, so I need to
build it from source.
---
I remember this taking a while. Uh, maybe I should look
at other things.
---
Nevermind? It just finsihed as I wrote this. That's
not a great sign.
---
Ran into build issues. Great. Downloading from git,
using the APKBUILD as hints.
---
MPlayer is kinda SVN? But this build script is
using git?

@11:40 Attempts to get mplayer working on thinkpad begins. #mplayer-jack-thinkpad #timelog:00:48:13

@12:01 Going to try building the package instead of source. #mplayer-jack-thinkpad
Not what I wanted to do, but here we are.
---
Bandwidth is slow even at the hub. git feels slow too.
I wonder how much faster it'd be on a newer laptop.

@12:09 going to attempt to get abuild to run #mplayer-jack-thinkpad

@12:19 It builds! But I wasn't sure how to install it #mplayer-jack-thinkpad
Build time wasn't too bad, so I'm rebuilding.

@12:20 Where is "pkgdir"? #mplayer-jack-thinkpad
Package installed in =packages/community/x86_64=.

@12:24 attempting to install manually #mplayer-jack-thinkpad
Can be done with =apk add foo.apk=. I don't think I needed
the =--allow-untrusted= flag because it was self-signed.

@12:26 works! #mplayer-jack-thinkpad
I love how straightforward that was.
