@07:48 Morning triage

@08:12 Connection remarks next, then what? #dagzet-rust
My goal is to use this rust port as a drop-in
replacement for my current dagzet program.
So, a good thing to do would be to write a program
that scrapes all the current commands used in
my RC dagzet instance.

I also have more than enough here to begin
working on implementing topological sort
and SQLite code generation.

@08:19 Clock resets are going to throw off gesture algorithm #demo-trio
One of the things I am doing in Trio is forcing
a phase reset on pen down so the voices always
stagger the same way. The funderlying rephasor in
the gesture signal generator does not have a way
of handling phase resets, so it'll assume a faster
tempo change and cause unwanted jumps in time.
The rephasor needs a way to be told that there
has been a phase reset, which would cause it to
skip calculating the delta time in the next
sample tick.

I wonder if we can build a test around this?

@08:26 Task created for gesture reset #gesture-reset #demo-trio
I want to not only do the fix, but create a test
in the test suite that showcases the problem before
the fix is created, just so I know that I properly
understand the problem that I am trying to solve.
