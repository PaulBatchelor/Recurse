@2024-06-29 Day 41. Halfway.
41 days left of batch.
---
Exactly halfway now. Perfectly balanced.
---
Moving forward,
I'm going to be reducing my check-in presence on Zulip
now. I'll still post links to my daily logs, but no
words until the end of the week (Friday), where I'll
do a weekly digest.
---
I have an idea-concept for my interactions at the hub.
I want to be my physically present here. Now that have
this Fancy Laptop, why not try to set up a usual spot and
work out in the open?
The corner of the fourth floor lunch table is a strategic
location. Lots of people around here, and it's also by
a power outlet (may need to get extension cord).
My goal is to become furniture at the hub. Be the rock
in the center of the river.
---
Actually, what if daily check-ins could be like haikus?
It's fun and creative, while also being an exercize
to summarize the day.
---
Haiku for previous day:
where did my nodes go? /
investigate TIC-80 /
remaining weeks planned
---
Today:

|| @!(taskref "bug-missing-nodes")!@: Plug away at
this for a bit.

|| @!(taskref "react-managing-state")!@: Print this
out, start reading a bit.

|| @!(taskref "buy-extension-cord")!@: I need a short
extension cord for my charger so people don't trip over
it.

|| @!(taskref "toc-logs")!@: 

@10:28 Late morning thoughts at the hub.

@10:42 Didn't get around to doing this one. Oh well. #voxbox-vcv

@10:43 I studied enough here. #vcv-potential-study
It was a helpful excercise, but I need to move forward.

@10:44 Bumping to priority because the page is starting to get big. #toc-logs

@10:46 Need a cord so people don't trip over my AC adapter #buy-extension-cord
Probably a target run today.

@10:48 zulip-ing

@10:51 Oh shoot, this machine isn't able to push to my website. Going to have to fix that when I get back home.

@13:03 Extension cord acquired! #buy-extension-cord

@11:20 Quick pairing with M: learning how to make typescript react
installed npx:

===
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo npm i -g npx
#+END_SRC
===

---
Got to figure out why this npx command didn't work:

===
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
#+END_SRC
===

Solution: [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7718313/how-to-change-to-an-older-version-of-node-js]]
---
Instll n, run =n stable=. Basically, the version
of node was "bleeding edge".
---
And we're running!

@14:01 Getting thinkpad SSH key ready #thinkpad-uploader

@14:38 Back at the hub.

@14:39 Looking at this again today. #bug-missing-nodes #timelog:01:04:58

@14:44 Do the nodes ever make it in the main sort loop? #bug-missing-nodes
Using =magsign_cpp= as an example, which currently has
the id of 146.
---
It doesn't seem to be showing up.

@14:52 checking connections #bug-missing-nodes
Connections look right.

@15:01 what are the initial "no incoming nodes"? #bug-missing-nodes
This comes next after populating connections.
I have a feeling that calling =table.remove=
and =table.insert= aren't doing the things I expected.

---
Checking these nodes.
---
I mean, I guess it looks right?

@15:16 How to trace what would need to happen to reach "cpp" node (missing) #bug-missing-nodes
"cpp" would have to be added to the "no incoming" table.
Which, I would expect wouldn't be happening.
---
The =nodes_connected_to= function: which way is the
direction? if "nodes connected to A" returns B,
is it "B->A" or "A->B"?
---
It's checking if the node is on the left, so
"A->B", so the parent nodes.
---
If this is true,
=header_file_looks_like_boilerplate= (id 137) should
return the =cpp= node (id 134). Let's test this.
---
It's not showing up. Nevermind that was my fault.
---
Okay the cpp node is indeed showing up as expected.

@15:39 check how many times cpp node shows up? #bug-missing-nodes
This is insightful: the cpp node shows up 2/3 times.
The missing node here is =magsign_cpp=. So, =cpp=
might be forever missing if =magsign_cpp= is missing.
That's enough for today.

@16:01 Time to make a log TOC #toc-logs #timelog:00:24:54

@16:18 adding "jump to top" links.

@16:22 functional. But I'm finding title errors now.
Hopefully I just wrote them in wrong.

@16:25 It would be great to retrospectively add titles to days #toc-logs #add-day-titles
So, I've added a task for this. @!(taskref "add-day-titles")!@.

@16:27 okay it all works now! #toc-logs

@18:14 Printing and transferring to RM #react-managing-state #timelog:00:14:00

@18:28 Off to hub. Some attempts to try reading there.

@18:45 React reading: reacting to input with state #react-managing-state #timelog:00:32:21

@19:41 React reading: choosing the right state #timelog:00:27:44

@20:15 Bang on electric keys in the hub. Loudly sing half-remembered songs.

@21:00 go home.
