@2024-06-27 Day 41. Halfway.
41 days left of batch.
---
Exactly halfway now. Perfectly balanced.
---
Moving forward,
I'm going to be reducing my check-in presence on Zulip
now. I'll still post links to my daily logs, but no
words until the end of the week (Friday), where I'll
do a weekly digest.
---
I have an idea-concept for my interactions at the hub.
I want to be my physically present here. Now that have
this Fancy Laptop, why not try to set up a usual spot and
work out in the open?
The corner of the fourth floor lunch table is a strategic
location. Lots of people around here, and it's also by
a power outlet (may need to get extension cord).
My goal is to become furniture at the hub. Be the rock
in the center of the river.
---
Actually, what if daily check-ins could be like haikus?
It's fun and creative, while also being an exercize
to summarize the day.
---
Haiku for previous day:
where did my nodes go? /
investigate TIC-80 /
remaining weeks planned
---
Today:

|| @!(taskref "bug-missing-nodes")!@: Plug away at
this for a bit.

|| @!(taskref "react-managing-state")!@: Print this
out, start reading a bit.

|| @!(taskref "buy-extension-cord")!@: I need a short
extension cord for my charger so people don't trip over
it.

|| @!(taskref "toc-logs")!@: 

@10:28 Late morning thoughts at the hub.

@10:42 Didn't get around to doing this one. Oh well. #voxbox-vcv

@10:43 I studied enough here. #vcv-potential-study
It was a helpful excercise, but I need to move forward.

@10:44 Bumping to priority because the page is starting to get big. #toc-logs

@10:46 Need a cord so people don't trip over my AC adapter #buy-extension-cord
Probably a target run today.

@10:48 zulip-ing
