@2024-06-14 Day 26. Compile Potential VCV Rack plugins, More Gesture Path
57 days left of batch.
---
Prev: Thinking In React @!(taskref "react-thinking-in-react")!@, 
Some initial work on a potential chords demo @!(taskref "chords-demo")!@,
some initial work on implementing
a basic Gesture Path Algorithm in Rust @!(taskref
"implement-gesture-path")!@, infrastructure in my
task management system @!(taskref "create-dagzet-todo-page")!@.
--
Next: More React stuff @!(taskref "react-first-component")!@,
Continuing building out the initial gesture
path @!(taskref "implement-gesture-path")!@, try to compile
Potential VCV @!(taskref "compile-potential-vcv")!@,
tract size control if there's time? @!(taskref "voxbox-size-control")!@.

@09:00 Morning Triage #morning-triage #timelog:00:14:20

@09:06 I have follow-ups to this now #create-dagzet-todo-page
see: @!(taskref "test-dz-log-task-linking")!@. Calling
this one done now.

@09:14 Will return back to this. #morning-triage

@09:25 Okay Back I think. #morning-triage #timelog:00:29:42

@09:35 Working on Zulip Check-in.

@09:45 Tract-size control would be helpful for finding shapes #voxbox-size-control
I think the secret to getting a better ensemble sound is going to be
tuning vowel shapes for each particular voice type (soprano,
alto, tenor, bass). Each of these need slightly different
tract sizes. It would be very helpful if there were a way
to dynamically adjust the size. No idea if this would work.

@10:07 Starting react: your first component. #react-first-component #timelog:00:41:03
@10:10 You know what, I'm printing and sending this to my remarkable #react-first-component
I don't want the eye strain reading on this OLED screen.

@10:18 Printed all the sections in this chapter, including this one. #react-first-component #react-describing-ui
I didn't realize how the documentation was organized. So,
I've created a new task called @!(taskref "react-describing-ui")!@.

@10:19 Making new chapter tasks, a bit of a tangent #react-first-component

@10:25 Getting back to reading, now on RM.
@10:52 Okay done with this section. #react-first-component #react-describing-ui
I'll just be tacking on reading progress on this section
on @!(taskref "react-describing-ui")!@ from this point forward.

@11:02 Lunch

@12:00 Play some guitar
I've been trying to pick out "Fire and Rain" on acoustic
guitar by ear.

@12:36 Setting up example file scaffolding #implement-gesture-path #timelog:00:14:18

@12:54 Trying to work out how path arguments will work #implement-gesture-path #timelog:00:13:59
I think the path argument might just be a reference to an array
of gesture vertices, which seems to mean lifetimes. no no, this
will be good for me.

@12:58 Refreshing myself on lifetimes in the Rust book #implement-gesture-path
In theory, I think I have something that *might* work. But now I have
to get back to interfaces.

@13:08 Trying to get the traits working to fit my mental model #implement-gesture-path #timelog:00:41:46

@13:51 Let's see what works and what breaks in the example #implement-gesture-path #timelog:00:59:04
Amazingly, it seems to mostly work.

@14:40 There's a bit of a logic bug. #implement-gesture-path
Right now the example timings are off.

@14:53 Get the example to sing tom's diner #implement-gesture-path #timelog:00:30:20
I realized I had to make sure behavior logic was working as
expected =(Aval -> (A_dur, A_bhvr) -> B_val)=

@15:24 It's working! Adding example to this repo #implement-gesture-path

@16:03 Off to Hub

@16:15 Jam With Dan and Scott, Midinous

@20:09 Trying to compile potential vcv now #compile-potential-vcv
Got a make error.
---
Reading through Rack dev tutorial [[https://vcvrack.com/manual/Building]]
---
Okay this is going to take a while. Sigh. Will get back to this.

20:30 Back at it #compile-potential-vcv #timelog:00:17:22
20:45 It builds, and it seems to open up in VCV Rack #compile-potential-vcv
I put the potential repo in the plugins folder of the Rack
directory. Also, compiled Rack from source.

21:00 Okay I've seen enough. I'll have to see what I can do to study this. #compile-potential-vcv
