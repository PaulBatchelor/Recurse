Continuing building out the initial gesture
path @!(taskref "implement-gesture-path")!@, try to compile

@09:00 Morning Triage #morning-triage #timelog 14:20

@09:06 I have follow-ups to this now #create-dagzet-todo-page
see: @!(taskref "test-dz-log-task-linking"). Calling
this one done now.

@09:14 Will return back to this. #morning-triage

@09:25 Okay Back I think. #morning-triage #timelog 00:00

@09:35 Working on Zulip Check-in.

@09:45 Tract-size control would be helpful for finding shapes #voxbox-size-control
I think the secret to getting a better ensemble sound is going to be
tuning vowel shapes for each particular voice type (soprano,
alto, tenor, bass). Each of these need slightly different
tract sizes. It would be very helpful if there were a way
to dynamically adjust the size. No idea if this would work.
