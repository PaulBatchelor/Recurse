@20:18 implementing fallback chords #demo-trio-chords #timelog:00:17:27
It occured to me yesterday that I am actually
close to a proof-of-concept system. I already
have one heuristic working. I don't need to
build out the others yet.

I do need to build a fallback set of chords in
case a chord isn't found for a particular note.

@20:44 Figuring out how to actually hook this up #demo-trio-chords #timelog:00:28:53

@21:42 Find upper/lower voices of chord... how to? #demo-trio-chords
Instead of a lookup table, dynamically find the
closest voices above and below a lead note given
a chord.

@21:52 Note to self: chord select needs to reset on note off some how #demo-trio-chords

@21:57 Initial tests made. That's all I can do. #demo-trio-chords
I am incredibly exhausted today. What a long day.
