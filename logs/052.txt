@10:47 Late morning triage

@11:11 This feels complete #demo-react-UI #voxsculpt-preset-manager
I don't have preset import/export, but that
can be another task.

@11:16 Singing tablet demo features to add #drawing-tablet-demo #timelog:00:56:06

intensity

@11:36 Publishing.

@12:02 Trying out my new x-pen #drawing-tablet-experiments
