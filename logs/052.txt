@2024-07-10 Day 52. I do not understand how tic80 sound works.
30 days left of batch.

Drawing tablets. lots /

so many tablets

Next:

|| @!(taskref "tic80-sine-tone")!@: begin initial work
on this

|| @!(taskref "drawing-tablet-experiments")!@: get new tablet working

|| @!(taskref "drawing-tablet-demo")!@: start building
out the singing demo.

@09:38 Sending this off. #resume-setup

@10:47 Late morning triage

@11:11 This feels complete #demo-react-UI #voxsculpt-preset-manager
I don't have preset import/export, but that
can be another task.

@11:14 This would be a good day to try to work on this #tic80-sine-tone

@11:16 Singing tablet demo features to add #drawing-tablet-demo #timelog:00:56:06
I want pitch quantiziation, and a y-axis controlling
intensity

@11:36 Publishing.

@12:02 Trying out my new x-pen #drawing-tablet-experiments

@12:06 It works #drawing-tablet-experiments
32767 both directions. which potentially poses a problem
if you want the aspect ratio.
---
Just measured. 4x3 inches. so 4:3 ratio.
---
In theory, it's 15 bit resolution, which is
great considering the size. But is it actually
15-bit? or just upsampled.

@12:11 udev rules to use without sudo #drawing-tablet-experiments
Also wondering: how to get max resolution automatically
of touchpad?
---
Ah, yes it does @!(dzref "misc/libevdev_get_abs_maximum")!@

@12:20 Disabling the tablet from sway. #drawing-tablet-experiments
Note to self: I gotta organize this script better.

@12:24 Hook-up to singer #drawing-tablet-experiments

@12:38 Tongue shape control. #drawing-tablet-experiments

@14:00 Lunch.

@14:45 Creative coding show and tell

@15:20 Attempts to get a sine tone playing in tic80 #tic80-sine-tone #timelog:01:19:56

@15:24 =update_amp()=, what does that do? #tic80-sine-tone
Ah, I don't think I have to care about that, I can
process data directly.

@16:22 runPcm not working. going a level down. #tic80-sine-tone

@16:26 How does =tic_tool_noise= generate sound?
Wait, =runNoise= is what I want.

@16:55 Wow, I am having a hard time grokking this code #tic80-sine-tone
I don't understand what =update_amp= is doing. It seems
to be some kind of delta encoding.
---
I'm just putting printf statements in functions now
to see what runs and happens.

@17:39 the =tic_sound_register_data= is key #tic80-sine-tone
It can be found in =core.h=. The value I think that
is relevant for an arbitrary sine tone is "amp",
which is the "current amp in the delta buffer". Does
that mean the amp is delta encoded or PCM encoded?
---
There are 4 channels of sound.

@17:45 Follow-ups #tic80-sine-tone
How can I print any non-zero sound PCM values to
terminal?
---
What's the deal with registers? How do they end up
in a PCM buffer?
