@2024-06-04 Day 16. Game Jam Day.
Probably not going to have too much logging here.
Today is going to mostly be about getting the mechanics
and level designer interface working. Tomorrow will
hopefully be more about refinement and design.
@07:55 Scoping out gamejam stuff #game-jam
I inked up some of my thoughts, set up priorities, attempts
to focus what the game components will be.
@09:00 nap
@09:32 morning triage
@09:32 let's revisit the code #rework-rectangles #game-jam
@09:47 it would be nice to get rid of tubePos #rework-rectangles #game-jam

@09:51 it's going to take to much time to recode this properly I think #rework-rectangles #game-jam
I guess I'll have to live with it?

@09:53 hmm, maybe I can start by trying to introduce global x offset #rework-rectangles #game-jam

@10:00 trying to make tubes immutable data #rework-rectangles #game-jam
Instead of updating the xoffset every time, create a new
rectangle with global X offset applied.

@10:09 attempt to establish more low-level rectangle format in JSON #rework-rectangles #game-jam
I don't necessarily want double rectangles every time any more.
---
I have the schema, but more refactoring is needed. I want to
load the raw rectangle and skip the tube positions (which
then copy over to the rectangles).

@10:17 might need to eliminate tubePos at this point? #rework-rectangles #game-jam
The JSON file is loading rectangles directly, I don't think
tubePos is required anymore?

@10:57 JSON rectangle format works! now to generate in lua #rework-rectangles #game-jam
@11:00 Game Jam #game-jam
@12:00 Audio Hang
@13:00 Quick Meet #game-jam
@13:30 Lunch
@14:00 Game Jam #game-jam
@15:20 Brainstorm: what kind of interaction should blocks have? #game-jam
@19:11 Brainstorm: some level design #game-jam
