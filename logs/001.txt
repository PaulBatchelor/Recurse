Day 2. Still remote.
@8:35 Task system
I'm attempting to think up a simplified version of
my zetdo system for use with RC. zetdo is built on
top of weewiki/zet, which has too many intermediate parts.
Ideally, I'd like to build up a simple markup that can
be parsed and compiled into data for further processing
later.

Tasks have the following parts: a sentence describing the
system, an optional description, and then a list of
timestamped comments that can be arranged as a thread.
Occasionally I group tasks into lists, but I haven't
done anything complex enough to warrant a formal dependency
system.

For now, using my "descript" notation could be enough.
This would allow me to easily build uniquely named blocks
where each block could represent a task.

```
@foo-task this is a foo task
this is a foo description
```

My timeline notation can then link to tasks using tags

```

@08:48 I am writing a test comment for the foo task. #foo-task
```
