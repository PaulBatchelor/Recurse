@09:51 Implement query. #demo-trio-chords #timelog:00:59:53
Query: given a current chord, and a new lead
note, find all the valid chords to transition to.

@12:57 transition tracker #demo-trio-chords

@13:50 Going to rework query to be immutable
This requires moving the mutable stateful stuff out.

@14:06 Something is wrong with the query. #demo-trio-chords
I am trying to transition D4 in the key of C. This
should give me two chords (G and Dm). But I'm getting
no chords.

Ah, my "RE" constant was miscoded. Phew.

@14:13 Need a way to remove candidate chords in place #demo-trio-chords
Chords need to be removed.

@14:23 I'm running into overflow issues. Why? #demo-trio-chords
Oh just figured it out. I was using "chord index" instead
of "index".
