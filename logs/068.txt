@09:04 Morning Triage

@09:24 Might try to get to this today #voxbox-balloon
I can test it out in Poke

@09:51 Implement query. #demo-trio-chords #timelog:00:59:53
Query: given a current chord, and a new lead
note, find all the valid chords to transition to.

@12:57 transition tracker #demo-trio-chords #timelog:02:41:39

@13:50 Going to rework query to be immutable
This requires moving the mutable stateful stuff out.

@14:06 Something is wrong with the query. #demo-trio-chords
I am trying to transition D4 in the key of C. This
should give me two chords (G and Dm). But I'm getting
no chords.
---
Ah, my "RE" constant was miscoded. Phew.

@14:13 Need a way to remove candidate chords in place #demo-trio-chords
Chords need to be removed.

@14:23 I'm running into overflow issues. Why? #demo-trio-chords
Oh just figured it out. I was using "chord index" instead
of "index".

@15:07 Initial test created for note transition chord test #demo-trio-chords
This has an interface that applies the heuristic to the
candidate, which effectively removes the previous chord
in place.

@15:12 kind of a clunky interface, but it can be reworked later #demo-trio-chords
I'm querying the chord, removeing the previous transition chord,
and updating the note pair table in 3 separate steps. It
feels maybe too low-level and could be consolidated
better?

@15:22 remove previous transition not working as expected #demo-trio-chords
It has no effect at all apparently.

@15:34 I think I found an off by one error #demo-trio-chords
I'm 99% sure it's the problem, but is it worth the problem?

There are two kinds of references right now: zero-index
and one-indexed. The one-indexed ones are used because
it means 0 can be reserved for None. =was_used_last=
expects a zero-indexed chord. But really, these indexes
are transparent for the most part. =add_chord= returns
a zero-indexed position as well.
---
I think it makes sense to 1-index everything because
that 0 is so critical.

@15:52 Fixed indexing #demo-trio-chords
Wow, that was tedious. Glad I had the tests. It almost
makes me wished I used =Option<T>=...

@15:56 What happens if the current note doesn't have a valid state transition? #demo-trio-chords
There is no way to account for this yet. It will catch it as
having zero candidates though.

@15:58 I'm now realizing that my look-up table should just be 12x12, not 12x11 #demo-trio-chords
Because it's harder to calculate what that second index
is going to be. There also needs to be a check to make
sure prev/next is not equal.
