@2024-05-26 Day 7. Recurse Wiki is born. Initial log generator plans

Sunday. I'm starting to think maybe just build a recurse
weewiki? In many ways it's the path of least resistance.

@08:57 Initial weewiki setup #htmlize-knowledge-tree

@09:07 Create HTML export script #htmlize-knowledge-tree
I don't actually have a boilerplate script for this.

@09:24 extract dagzet tools from brain wiki #htmlize-knowledge-tree
Now that there's a weewiki here, things should be more
straight forward.

@09:50 Things work #htmlize-knowledge-tree

@09:57 Generate sqlite code from logs #htmlize-logs
I'm not going to worry about the tag system here, that
can happen later. I just want to be able to add the
timestamps and messages.

@10:16 Create log db generator script #htmlize-logs

@10:30 Trying to get line breaks to work in comments #htmlize-logs
This would be one line.
This would continue the same line because there isn't an
empty line.

---

This would be another line.

---

It looks like the parser I wrote ignores the extra line
breaks. Rather than try to update the parser, I'm going
to say that a line "---" will insert a line break, which
makes sense.

@10:41 Create an initial logs page #htmlize-logs

@11:33 Ran into debugging hole related to checking for valid key #htmlize-logs
I should have been using an "or" operation instead of "and".
Funny how I keep confusing the two.

---

This whole rabbit hole started because what I was calling
"comment" in the time events, I called "blurb" in the dayblurb.
I was accidentally trying to get a comment from a dayblurb
instead of a blurb. It was returning nil, and it was still
considering it valid. I had to update the conditional logic.

@11:36 Back to getting a single day printed using weewiki #htmlize-logs

@11:38 Now to render all days on one page programatically
Get all available dates, and then render each one by day.

@11:48 Okay why is day 3 stopping midway #htmlize-logs
I'm hoping it's not a weewiki thing because that would
be tedious.

@11:51 Seeing if static export works #htmlize-logs

@11:52 What is going on with day 3? #htmlize-logs

@11:54 Okay, I think it's string escaping issue in janet #htmlize-logs

@12:00 I have no great way to escape the inline janet syntax. #htmlize-logs
In weewiki, I use =@!(foo "bar")!@= to do inline janet stuff,
but in Day 3 I was using that in another context. The workaround
is to put it in a code block.

@12:03 Is static export broken for dagzet?

@12:06 Ah, it seems I wrote a one-liner to generate all directories needed

@12:08 Export script updated. Things work now.

@12:09 Try to upload to website?

@12:13 uh-oh.
I shouldn't be nested git repos like this

@12:18 upload script works, now to add jump links for each day #htmlize-logs
Adding for each entry would be cool too!

@12:37 Now to add timestamp links #htmlize-logs

@12:46 Note to self: do not render raw HTML in an org block #htmlize-logs

@12:50 Things seem to work now #htmlize-logs

@12:53 dagzet HTML isn't correct on mobile

@13:03 Looks like I accidentally removed the viewport width HTML metadata

@15:37 Planning and wiki-ing

@16:02 initial setup stuff for logs to sqlite data #task-sqlite-gen
Just getting the boilerplate code and parser hooked up.

@16:27 I think I have most of the data being parsed #task-sqlite-gen
