@2024-05-26 Day 7.
Sunday. I'm starting to think maybe just build a recurse
weewiki? In many ways it's the path of least resistance.

@08:57 Initial weewiki setup #htmlize-knowledge-tree

@09:07 Create HTML export script #htmlize-knowledge-tree
I don't actually have a boilerplate script for this.

@09:24 extract dagzet tools from brain wiki #htmlize-knowledge-tree
Now that there's a weewiki here, things should be more
straight forward.
