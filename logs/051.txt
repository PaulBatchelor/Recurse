a proof of concept voice-theremin, precursor to interface
work for @!(taskref "drawing-tablet-demo")!@ mechanics.

|| @!(taskref "demo-react-UI")!@ WebAudio work.

|| @!(taskref "LC75")!@: make PDF versions so I can
read on RM tablet.

|| @!(taskref "consider-poke-follow-up")!@: please
write some tasks. I think I want to push myself to
iterate.

@07:51 Morning Triage.

@08:02 Escape hatches next on the React reading list #react-escape-hatches

@08:16 have this work for wacom and xp-pen #drawing-tablet-demo
I have access to a Wacom tablet now, and I kind of
love the size of it.

@08:19 Didn't get to this yesterday, today hopefully #demo-react-UI

@08:19 Initial investigation completed, now onto initial challenge: sine tone test. #investigate-tic80-audio #tic80-sine-tone
I think I know about enough to get started on hacking
in a sine tone into the TIC-80 sound codebase.
---
A sine tone is ideal because it's a pitched pure tone,
and it can be easy to tell if I'm getting the buffering
and sample rate correct. If I can get a sine.

@08:22 Drawing tablet experiment vs demo #drawing-tablet-demo #drawing-tablet-experiments
There is a bit of overlap here. I want the end of the
"drawing tablet experiments" to have sound, and the
"drawing tablet demo" to build up from that initial demo,
tuning the sound better, and adding an abstraction
that will make it easy to go between tablets.

@08:24 Did not get to this yesterday. #LC75
In the true yak-shaving tradition, I want to build
a quick webscraper that takes all the links in
the LC75 page and then prints them to PDF.
From there, I can view them on my remarkable, so
I can be a way from my computer and study them with
pen and paper.

@08:27 Write some tasks today please. #consider-poke-follow-up
I think it would be good for me to iterate on this.
I'm getting great feedback.

@08:28 Pokey fella needs to laugh #consider-poke-follow-up

@08:30 There needs to be a sound warning #consider-poke-follow-up #poke-sound-warning
Someone yesterday got very surprised by the sound and
immediately closed the browser. Oops.

@08:39 Publish

@09:00 Some experiments with the wacom. #drawing-tablet-experiments #timelog:00:36:51

@09:01 What model is this Wacom Tablet? #drawing-tablet-experiments
Wacom Intuos PT M 2, according to dmesg. Researching.
---
More specifically: CTH-690 [Intuos Art (M)]
(using product/vendor ID lookup).
---
Super cheap to buy on ebay.

@09:25 I have to learn about the finger tracking information here #drawing-tablet-experiments
Is it multi-touch?

@09:39 ABS_MT_SLOT keeps track of multi-touch points I think. #drawing-tablet-experiments
I'm counting 10 points multitouch.
---
X axis resolution: ~2143 (2150?), Y axis resolution: ~1333

@09:49 Time to make some noise. #drawing-tablet-experiments #timelog:01:07:40

@09:54 gotta build libsoundio on this device to get jack backend #drawing-tablet-experiments

@09:57 voxboxOSC builds and runs. now to extract the relevant bits. #drawing-tablet-experiments
No need for the OSC bits, but the sound and DSP are a good
start.

@10:13 time to get the code tablet hooked up #drawing-tablet-experiments
udev permissions are in order.

@10:33 Only set pitch when pen is down. #drawing-tablet-experiments

@10:47 It works. Gotta place with this thing now. #drawing-tablet-experiments

@10:54 Adding files and committing. #drawing-tablet-experiments

@11:40 Experimenting with tablets again
Tried to an xp-pen tablet working that Seamus had. Could not
use evdev to parse the tablet events for whatever reason,
but I could read the raw bytes using cat and xxd.

@12:00 Audio Hang

@13:00 Lunch

@13:42 Now what?

@13:44 Initial work on web scraper for LC75 #LC75-scraper #timelog:01:11:40

@14:00 wget doesn't work, curl doesn't work, selenium hangs #LC75-scraper

@14:05 trying wget again #LC75-scraper

@14:13 I just copy-pasted from the view source in browser #LC75-scraper
It had the data embedded in there from a JSON blob.
I was able to extract it in Vim. Currently jq-ing it.
---
Here is my big query:

===
#+BEGIN_SRC
jq .props.pageProps.dehydratedState.queries[0].state.data.studyPlanV2Detail.planSubGroups data_pretty.json
#+END_SRC
===

@14:34 Picking apart LC75.json data #LC75-scraper
It's an array of items, split up by category (of
which there are 22 categories). Each entry is an
object with a =questionNum= field. When you add
all the =questionNum=s together, you get 75.
---
The key I want for the URL is =titleSlug=, and
the id is =questionFrontendId= for the LC (I can
use this to reference the problem tersely online).
These are objects found in the "questions" objects,
aka =.[0].questions[0]=.

@14:44 Headless print on linux? #LC75-scraper
It's not going to matter.

@14:49 I have hit a security wall #LC75-scraper

@14:57 Can use wayback machine with limited success #LC75-scraper
Given a leetcode article, I can find a cached version
on wayback machine, which I can then curl to
an HTML file. Most of the HTML can be stripped using
=w3m -dump=.

@15:27 Does wayback machine have an API for getting cached pages? #LC75-scraper #timelog:00:15:48
It does! There's a URL you can query and get a JSON
response from. It does produce HTML, but, even with
w3m it does seem to be kinda messy. Damn.

@16:00 making some follow-up tasks for poke. #consider-poke-follow-up #timelog:00:07:15

@16:01 Sounds events should happen when there's a collision #consider-poke-follow-up #poke-collision-sounds

@16:03 successive pokes should build up energy #poke-evolving-sounds #poke-evolving-sounds
For example, my "balloon" control signal generator
could probably work here.

@16:07 poke pellets: drop things to have the fella eat #consider-poke-follow-up #poke-pellets

@16:08 Implement laughter and chitter sounds #consider-poke-follow-up #poke-laughter-chitter

@16:18 More webaudio code porting #demo-react-UI #timelog:00:35:00
Note to self: we're calling this voxsculpt.

@16:52 Mostly works. Now the rest. #demo-react-UI

@16:53 "User aborted request" #demo-react-UI
Happens when I attempt "await startAudio" in onclick callback.

@16:58 Sound is made, but sliders do not control anything. #demo-react-UI #timelog:01:10:44
Also paired with Dan to help out with things.

@19:04 Troubleshooting xp-pen tablet. #drawing-tablet-experiments #timelog:00:23:34
