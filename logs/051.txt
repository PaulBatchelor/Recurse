a proof of concept voice-theremin, precursor to interface
work for @!(taskref "drawing-tablet-demo")!@ mechanics.

|| @!(taskref "demo-react-UI")!@ WebAudio work.

|| @!(taskref "LC75")!@: make PDF versions so I can
read on RM tablet.

|| @!(taskref "consider-poke-follow-up")!@: please
write some tasks. I think I want to push myself to
iterate.

@07:51 Morning Triage.

@08:02 Escape hatches next on the React reading list #react-escape-hatches

@08:16 have this work for wacom and xp-pen #drawing-tablet-demo
I have access to a Wacom tablet now, and I kind of
love the size of it.

@08:19 Didn't get to this yesterday, today hopefully #demo-react-UI

@08:19 Initial investigation completed, now onto initial challenge: sine tone test. #investigate-tic80-audio #tic80-sine-tone
I think I know about enough to get started on hacking
in a sine tone into the TIC-80 sound codebase.
---
A sine tone is ideal because it's a pitched pure tone,
and it can be easy to tell if I'm getting the buffering
and sample rate correct. If I can get a sine.

@08:22 Drawing tablet experiment vs demo #drawing-tablet-demo #drawing-tablet-experiments
There is a bit of overlap here. I want the end of the
"drawing tablet experiments" to have sound, and the
"drawing tablet demo" to build up from that initial demo,
tuning the sound better, and adding an abstraction
that will make it easy to go between tablets.

@08:24 Did not get to this yesterday. #LC75
In the true yak-shaving tradition, I want to build
a quick webscraper that takes all the links in
the LC75 page and then prints them to PDF.
From there, I can view them on my remarkable, so
I can be a way from my computer and study them with
pen and paper.

@08:27 Write some tasks today please. #consider-poke-follow-up
I think it would be good for me to iterate on this.
I'm getting great feedback.

@08:28 Pokey fella needs to laugh #consider-poke-follow-up

@08:30 There needs to be a sound warning #consider-poke-follow-up #poke-sound-warning
Someone yesterday got very surprised by the sound and
immediately closed the browser. Oops.

@08:39 Publish

@09:00 Some experiments with the wacom. #drawing-tablet-experiments #timelog:00:36:51

@09:01 What model is this Wacom Tablet? #drawing-tablet-experiments
Wacom Intuos PT M 2, according to dmesg. Researching.
---
More specifically: CTH-690 [Intuos Art (M)]
(using product/vendor ID lookup).
---
Super cheap to buy on ebay.

@09:25 I have to learn about the finger tracking information here #drawing-tablet-experiments
Is it multi-touch?

@09:39 ABS_MT_SLOT keeps track of multi-touch points I think. #drawing-tablet-experiments
I'm counting 10 points multitouch.
---
X axis resolution: ~2143 (2150?), Y axis resolution: ~1333

@09:49 Time to make some noise. #drawing-tablet-experiments #timelog:01:07:40

@09:54 gotta build libsoundio on this device to get jack backend #drawing-tablet-experiments

@09:57 voxboxOSC builds and runs. now to extract the relevant bits. #drawing-tablet-experiments
No need for the OSC bits, but the sound and DSP are a good
start.

@10:13 time to get the code tablet hooked up #drawing-tablet-experiments
udev permissions are in order.

@10:33 Only set pitch when pen is down. #drawing-tablet-experiments

@10:47 It works. Gotta place with this thing now. #drawing-tablet-experiments

@10:54 Adding files and committing. #drawing-tablet-experiments
