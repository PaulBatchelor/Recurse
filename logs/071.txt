This past weekend was very heads down. I didn't do
my usual morning triage.
@08:54 Morning triage.

@09:40 How does this sound today? #demo-trio
Added a new shape. Really expressive now. Vibrato not
as bad as I remembered (with headphones on now instead of speakers).

Should resolve to tonic more often. There should be a built
in bias to choose tonic.
---
I'm desiring the instantaneous mode again.
---
The chord changes are happening too quickly.
If I select a pitch, go down quickly, and og back up,
the chord shouldn't change. But it does.
