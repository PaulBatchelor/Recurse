11 days left of batch

This past weekend was very heads down. I didn't do
my usual morning triage.
@08:54 Morning triage.

@09:40 How does this sound today? #demo-trio #timelog:00:40:00
Added a new shape. Really expressive now. Vibrato not
as bad as I remembered (with headphones on now instead of speakers).
---
Should resolve to tonic more often. There should be a built
in bias to choose tonic.
---
I'm desiring the instantaneous mode again.
---
The chord changes are happening too quickly.
If I select a pitch, go down quickly, and og back up,
the chord shouldn't change. But it does.

@10:11 Sounding chords are different from hypothetical ones #demo-trio
Right now, a changing pitch triggers a set of chord progressions.
But if they move too quickly, only the last one is heard.
Which means effectively an arbitrary chord transition.
---
How to prevent this? A chord isn't a chord until all 3 voices
commit. If the lead changes pitch, it uses the stored chord
as a reference point. As it continues to change, this chord
will continue to be used. The upper voice is the last
person to commit to a chord, so only then should the
reference chord be updated.
---
When the chord is officially committed for selection, only
then does that chord get registered in the chord frequency
table.

Oh my god this is consensus in a distributed system.
