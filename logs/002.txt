@2024-05-21 Day 2. Some initial system setups, various meetups
Day 2. Still remote.
@08:35 Task system
I'm attempting to think up a simplified version of
my zetdo system for use with RC. zetdo is built on
top of weewiki/zet, which has too many intermediate parts.
Ideally, I'd like to build up a simple markup that can
be parsed and compiled into data for further processing
later.

Tasks have the following parts: a sentence describing the
system, an optional description, and then a list of
timestamped comments that can be arranged as a thread.
Occasionally I group tasks into lists, but I haven't
done anything complex enough to warrant a formal dependency
system.

For now, using my "descript" notation could be enough.
This would allow me to easily build uniquely named blocks
where each block could represent a task.

> @foo-task this is a foo task
> this is a foo description

My timeline notation can then link to tasks using tags

> @2024-05-21
> @08:48 I am writing a test comment for the foo task. #foo-task

@08:51 Add some initial tasks #task-system-setup
What to do about tasks that are done? Maybe not think
too hard about it and move to a done.txt and a nevermind.txt
for tasks that I won't do.

@09:01 oops update descript #task-system-setup
There was a bug in my parser that I fixed previously.

@09:03 potential schema idea for tasks? #task-sqlite-gen
It seems like for groups/states, I'll be putting things
into files. So, current tasks are in main.txt, done
tasks are in done.txt, cancelled tasks nevermind.txt,
rust related things in rust.txt, reading in reading.txt,
etc. Filename could be a meaningful parameter in the
schema.

Useful for autocomplete tags in Vim

'iskeyword+=\-' was good enough for my needs.
---
I'm realizing that I may want to spend some time getting
used to how Rust is designed, instead of jumping
into code (though I already have some boilerplate
ready for porting DSP). I think overall things will
be faster if I figure out how to think in Rust, rather
than trying to apply my pre-existing notions of
programming towards Rust.

Seems like some decent wisdom. There are many links
and follow-ups, which may be worth looking at later.

@13:11 Update Log
@13:13 Skipped the pairing session
I'm feeling a little bit bad about this, so
I thought I'd write a few words on it.

Firstly, I'm exhausted. The time between my last
job and living situation and the start of my batch
was too short. I knew this coming in. I'm adjusting
to what are for me have been some huge life changes
in the last week.

Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, I think I'm also
a little intimidated? Imposter syndrome, etc, etc.
I've taken
about a six month break from writing code. Lots
of reading and research around the code. But
coding itself has been fairly sparse outside
of a few ad-hoc scripts. I also doubt my skills
a fair bit. I really only know a modest amount of C,
along with a handful of scripting languages on top
of that. DSP and realtime audio puts a limit the kind of
languages you get to study. Most languages used today
are simply not suitable for realtime or soft realtime
applications. As a result, I've never had many
opportunities to work much with other languages.

It's hard having that feel like the only
language you feel only sort of comfortable in.
I guess I wish I had more go-to "modern" languages that
are less niche.

I'm hoping I'll be better at getting over myself
in the next few weeks.

@13:24 Update Rust
Looks like this is just "rustup update"

@13:27 Revisit BoingBoingBoing
Can I get this to build and run still? Do I
understand what is happening?
---
Do I have examples, and if I do, can I build them
with Cargo? I think there's a way, and I'd like
to look it up the slow way (instead of
stackoverflow: find a good book online,
then find it inthe book)

Select distinct top-level nodes from dagzet

> select distinct(SUBSTR(name, 1, INSTR(name, "/") -1)) from dz_nodes

Curious if I can get secondary ones.
