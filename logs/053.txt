|| @!(taskref "poke-sound-warning")!@: shoot I forgot
to do this one yesterday.

|| @!(taskref "tic80-sine-tone")!@: Not completely
out of ideas yet

|| @!(taskref "drawing-tablet-demo")!@: time to transition
from experiment to demo

|| @!(taskref "dagzet-rust")!@: peak at this, if there
is time?

@08:28 This is not worth any more of my time.
Considering how few of these I'm realistically going
to get to, it's going to be easier to just manually
print them to PDF to get them on my RM. Solid attempt
though, had a good adventure.

@08:32 Ooops forgot. First thing today #poke-sound-warning

@08:33 I have a few more ideas on how to do this #tic80-sine-tone
Look at =tic_core_sound_tick_start=
and  =tic_core_sound_tick_end=.

@08:35 Officially concluded. #drawing-tablet-experiments
Now onto demo

@08:37 Drawing tablet demo: mono singing voice #drawing-tablet-demo
Going to try and timebox this to just today. What
I want is to get pitch snapping on x-axis,
reverb and delay effects, as well as y-axis intensity
control.

@08:39 Some initial boilerplate rust code would be nice to set up today if there's time #dagzet-rust

@08:40 Publishing

@08:51 Gotta add a sound warning to poke. #poke-sound-warning #timelog:00:04:57
