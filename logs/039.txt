@2024-06-27 Day 39. NeXT-ing. TIC80 investigations.
44 days left of batch.
---
Well, 43 days really. August 9th is a Friday.
---
prev: new thinkpad provisioning. react reading. codestudy
mostly seems to work (though I found another weird bug which
is probably unrelated).
---
next:
|| @!(taskref "nexthacking")!@: NeXT hacking today with JB.

|| @!(taskref "investigate-tic80")!@: Some initial tic80
investigations. I want to see how feasible it is to hack
the audio engine to play new synthesizers like my singing
synthesizer.

|| @!(taskref "what-now-week6")!@: I didn't really get
around to this yesterday.

|| @!(taskref "bug-missing-nodes")!@: Bug hunting

@08:04 Log started.

@08:05 How easy is it to build tic-80? #investigate-tic80 #timelog:00:30:26
Source @!(dzref "gamedev/tic80/github")!@.
---
Starting on my Mac. Looks like pretty typical CMake stuff.
---
Seems to work! now off to try Linux.
---
Going to try the vanilla CMake TIC80 instructions first.
I don't expect it'll work and I'll need to install packages.
---
Holy crap, the CMake script ran without any issues. That's
surprising.
---
Running into Makefile errors. Turning off -j flags.
---
"RAKE-NOTFOUND: not found": is this a ruby thing? It sounds like
a ruby thing. Installed ruby-rake and mruby and
then re-ran cmake. The build is moving forward.
---
TIC-80 seems to include most dependencies in the source
directory. This probably makes the thing a bit more portable.
Reminds me of how I think.
---
Wow! It built. It looks like there may be support for
JACK via pipewire. I've never actually looked into pipewire,
but if there's a way to use it with my existing
JACK applications, that would be great.
---
Oh crap. Alpine just permanently removed jackd when
I installed pipewire-jack.
---
Pipewire-jack research is going to be half a day
of research. Going to hold off for now. Fortunately,
I managed to re-install old jack.
---
If there is pipewire support for JACK that works with
TIC-80, I'd probably want to use that to get sound working
on my Linux box. Further reading @!(dzref "audio/pipewire_docs")!@.

@08:38 Morning triage.

@08:48 Deprioritizing. #voxbox-shape-morphing
It's going to need to get done, but I can't have it
in the priority bin like this.

@08:49 I think I've done enough for this research #investigate-2d-gameengine
I've just had the idea to look into tic-80 and hack the audio
engine. This seems to be most in the spirit of RC, and probably
going to be more fun than trying to get a bunch of graphics
libraries working.
---
Sokol would be what I'd want to try as well for something
similar to tic-80 graphics-wise, but that's more upfront
work.
---
There's always p5.js and friends for very quick rapid
prototyping. I really need to convince myself to try using
these for time constraints.

@08:52 I really need to get this done soon. #bucket-initial-scoping
Basically, "A Blob Named Bucket" will most likely be a
culmination of other mechanics I try out.
---
As I type this. I can't help but wonder if this will be
too time consuming to try and implement.
---
You know what. I'm going to story-board the gameplay
for bucket. That's what is missing.

@08:55 Task created #bucket-storyboard #bucket-initial-scoping
A good follow-up to my initial scoping.
I'm kind of paralyzed with tech stack choices, and I'm
very limited with time, so boiling down game design is a
good choice. I know how with a certain degree of accuracy
how long pen and paper takes.

@08:58 Finished reading this chapter yesterday #react-describing-ui

@09:00 Next react chapter: managing state #react-managing-state

@09:01 poke demo moved back to main #demo-poke
Probably won't get to it until next week.
This has been added to my priority group.

@09:03 Getting zulip check-in ready

@09:28 Some NeXT research #nexthacking #timelog:00:07:08

See: @!(dzref "retrocomputing/next")!@

@09:39 Quick time looking at the missing nodes #bug-missing-nodes #timelog:00:17:01

@10:00 NeXT-ing
@16:00 Presentations
@20:30 Home
