@08:05 How easy is it to build tic-80? #investigate-tic80 #timelog:00:30:26
Source @!(dzref "gamedev/tic80/github")!@.
---
Starting on my Mac. Looks like pretty typical CMake stuff.
---
Seems to work! now off to try Linux.
---
Going to try the vanilla CMake TIC80 instructions first.
I don't expect it'll work and I'll need to install packages.
---
Holy crap, the CMake script ran without any issues. That's
surprising.
---
Running into Makefile errors. Turning off -j flags.
---
"RAKE-NOTFOUND: not found": is this a ruby thing? It sounds like
a ruby thing. Installed ruby-rake and mruby and
then re-ran cmake. The build is moving forward.
---
TIC-80 seems to include most dependencies in the source
directory. This probably makes the thing a bit more portable.
Reminds me of how I think.
---
Wow! It built. It looks like there may be support for
JACK via pipewire. I've never actually looked into pipewire,
but if there's a way to use it with my existing
JACK applications, that would be great.
---
Oh crap. Alpine just permanently removed jackd when
I installed pipewire-jack.
---
Pipewire-jack research is going to be half a day
of research. Going to hold off for now. Fortunately,
I managed to re-install old jack.
---
If there is pipewire support for JACK that works with
TIC-80, I'd probably want to use that to get sound working
on my Linux box. Further reading @!(dzref "audio/pipewire_docs")!@.
