tic80 audio code and music player.

Right arm is a little sore today, probably
from typing too much yesterday. Going to lay off
a little bit today.

@09:21 Morning Triage

@09:40 Data for projects, then done? #resume-setup

@09:41 Impulsive idea to buy a drawing tablet today #consider-drawing-tablet
I've been on and off about this for a few days.
I think it could be a good interface to try
and tune vocal synth parameters. But, I should make a
decision by end of day.
---
Thinking about using this with my number pad, somehow.
I like the minimalism of the numpad, and consider
it an interesting interface challenge for the
task of musical sequencing. The tablet
could be a good way to get continuous fine tuned
gestural control.
---
Performance interface too?

@09:48 want to examine audio code and capabilities in tic80 today #investigate-tic80-audio
How hackable is it? Is it feasible to shove my rust
DSP code into the TIC80, audio callback, and control
it from tic80 code?
---
I think this could be a fruitful way to build an
ecosystem of toys that match my current aesthetic.
I have semi-long term plans for this potentially.
---
I say "semi-potentially" because for its constraints,
the software has quite a complex software stack. I
don't expect this to be the most portable thing
in the world. The most portable things are ideas,
and after that, bytes of data (8 bits to a byte
is fairly universal). There is a cartridge format,
which may end up being a promising data format
for portability, but we'll see.
---
Short term (as in this batch),
portability or longevity is not a concern. I just
want to hack stuff.

@09:56 Publish!

@10:00 taking a walk, thinking about tablets and interfaces and other such things #consider-drawing-tablet
