@2024-07-22 Day 64. Haptic Knob Controllers.
18 days left of batch.
---
I think Haikus have run their course.
---
Prev: briefly worked on rust Dagzet stuff @!(taskref "dagzet-rust")!@,
I have an idea of what I need to build out still to
get it working on the RC knowledge graph here: @!(ref "dz" "check it out")!@.
---
Next:

|| @!(taskref "dagzet-rust")!@: work on file range command,
in addition others.

|| @!(taskref "LC75")!@: study planning ideas

|| @!(taskref "demo-trio")!@: draft out voice
state machine

@08:50 Morning Triage.

@08:57 How can I work on this stuff offline? #LC75
Leetcode provides validation of solutions, which
is nice. But having a format that distills the
problems into something offline for reference
would be nice.
---
I think I might just manually transcribe the questions
to markdown and put them in a repo.

@09:03 good time to figure out pikchr? #demo-trio
I'm trying to more formally establish a way to
manage how the voice scheduling works for
trio.

@09:07 Publish

@09:16 Some initial inking of voice scheduler #demo-trio-voice-scheduler #timelog:00:49:09

@10:36 Attempts at initial code and tests #demo-trio-voice-scheduler

@11:23 How to set up event scheduling logic? #demo-trio-voice-scheduler #timelog:00:59:47
I have the basic actions and primitives
for the most part. Now, they need to be composed
and worked together to trigger events for
the other voices.
---
These events need to be triggered exactly once.
---
Event triggers at the start of a tick.
---
In a test, one should be able to tick() then
ask the state questions. Is the voice supposed to
launch? Is it playing already? Did the voice
just turn off? Is it supposed to turn off? Etc,
etc.
---
These events need to happen exactly once. Tick,
check and see if things need to be done, tick,
those things are done.
---
prev/curr state system could probably do this?
At each tick, update prev to be curr. So,
that means changes and probing would have to happen
together before the next tick?

@13:10 Inking out thoughts on triggers #demo-trio-voice-scheduler #timelog:00:20:12

@13:35 Attempts to implement triggers #demo-trio-voice-scheduler #timelog:01:57:19

@13:53 Core trigger built. Now to try to use them #demo-trio-voice-scheduler

@14:36 Inking and brainstorming #demo-trio-voice-scheduler
I was trying to figure out when to trigger certain events
like gates and pitch changes. I was has having difficulty
getting to the bottom of pitch changes for auto voices:
when they are initially turned on (happens when the gate
is first on), the pitch needs to be instantaneous, otherwise
it is scheduled. How does the voice know the difference?
What state information is needed?

@14:43 Introduce two boolean gates indicating on/off state for auto-voices? #demo-trio-voice-scheduler
This is the best I got so far.
---
Consider the state needed to determine a pitch change
for an autovoice: it happens when when the lead note
is on, and the timer has reached a particular value.
An extra value could be used to determine whether
to immediate set or schedule based on if the voice is
turned on.
---
An auto voice will always be immediately set to
a pitch first, and would therefore set the voice flag to
on. Subsequent voice changes will be scheduled until
this voice flag is turned off.
---
The only way the voice flag is turned off is when an
gate off event happens. This will turn off all the voices
in the state.

@14:51 attempting to code this line of thinking up #demo-trio-voice-scheduler
I'm tempted to have this be a set of state separate
from the current set of state. I believe you could make
the case that the flow of information is one-way:
changes from the main state influence the states of
the auto voices, and not the other way around.
---
Separating state like this I think will make it easier to
test.

@15:14 These states need triggers hooked into them now. #demo-trio-voice-scheduler

@15:41 initial firing logic works for a lower voice #demo-trio-voice-scheduler
Right now, it doesn't know the difference between
an instantaneous vs scheduled pitch change, but
the scaffolding is there.

@16:55 dagzet things? #dagzet-rust #timelog:00:05:00

@18:55 dagzet: file range work #dagzet-rust #timelog:00:28:08

@19:16 initial tests pass, but they are wrong #dagzet-rust

@19:38 Attempts to get the file range table working. #dagzet-rust
Okay, nevermind.

@20:16 Got distracted.
Haptic rotary knob controllers. What was I supposed to do?
