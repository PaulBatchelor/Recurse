18 days left of batch.

I think Haikus have run their course.
---
Prev: briefly worked on rust Dagzet stuff @!(taskref "dagzet-rust")!@,
I have an idea of what I need to build out still to
get it working on the RC knowledge graph here: @!(ref "dz" "check it out")!@.
---
Next:

|| @!(taskref "dagzet-rust")!@: work on file range command,
in addition others.

|| @!(taskref "LC75")!@: study planning ideas

|| @!(taskref "demo-trio")!@: draft out voice
state machine

@08:50 Morning Triage.

@08:57 How can I work on this stuff offline? #LC75
Leetcode provides validation of solutions, which
is nice. But having a format that distills the
problems into something offline for reference
would be nice.
---
I think I might just manually transcribe the questions
to markdown and put them in a repo.

@09:03 good time to figure out pikchr? #demo-trio
I'm trying to more formally establish a way to
manage how the voice scheduling works for
trio.
