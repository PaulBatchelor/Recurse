Feeling tired and groggy. Just like the weather.
@08:51 Arrival. Triage.

@09:00 Publishing.

@09:11 Chapter 6: Assembler #read-elem-compsys #timelog:00:54:55
I read the chapter in one sitting. I imagine it's
much easier to read about implementing an assembler
than it is to actually implement one. At
some point, I'll try to find time to actually
work this all out.

Teach Yourself Computer Science (TYCS) recommends
reading the first six chapters of this book. I have
done this. I think this is good enough.
