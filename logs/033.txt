|| @!(taskref "htmlize-codestudy-files")!@: Did not get to
this yesterday. Hopefully today.

|| @!(taskref "react-adding-interactivity")!@: More reading
on React.

|| @!(taskref "voxbox-change-nose-length")!@: shouldn't be too difficult to do

|| @!(taskref "voxbox-better-size-control")!@: if there's time today, try
to look at this.

|| @!(taskref "demo-poke")!@: Start brainstorming the "poke" demo

@08:58 Morning Triage

@09:07 Small task, hoping to get to it today. #voxbox-change-nose-length

@09:08 Will look at this today if there's time #voxbox-better-size-control

@09:10 created. initial brainstorming today? #demo-poke

@09:17 Writing up zulip checkin.

@09:30 Done with morning logging.

@09:48 Pack up for Apple appointment

@12:00 Lunch

@13:01 The poke should be a tickle. Think tickle-me-elmo, or the Pillsbury Doughboy #demo-poke

@13:02 Adding tractlen control to OSC model #voxbox-better-size-control #timelog:00:03:47
This will be a good way to test out tract length while on
my Linux box.

Actually, this won't work. Interpolation doesn't smooth
discontinuities, but allows smoothing transitions with
floating point values. I will need to build an example.

@13:08 Building tract length example instead #voxbox-better-size-control #timelog:00:06:00

@13:15 The glitches are there (deliberately), now to see if they can be smoothed #voxbox-better-size-control #timelog:00:30:00

@13:45 This is not working as expected #voxbox-better-size-control
I was hoping this would be a quick matter of linear interpolation
between the last two samples at the output, but I I'm still getting
issues. It's starting to turn into more of a DSP problem
than I'd like it be, which is not why I'm here at this
program. So, I'm putting it to rest for now.

The attempts are managed in the "tractlen" branch on
my voxbox repo

@14:50 trying one more thing... #voxbox-better-size-control #timelog:00:18:43
Somehow I think the fractional tract length needs to be
considered while computing the scatering junctions. But
I'm not sure how yet. I added in best guess but it's
not right. Okay I really really need to stop this.

@15:21 Reading and notetaking #react-adding-interactivity #timelog:00:19:07

@15:43 More reading and notetaking #react-adding-interactivity #timelog:00:18:49

@16:40 Attempts to study sourcehut CSS again #htmlize-codestudy-files #timelog:00:15:59

@16:46 Ha, okay I managed to make it go. Magic! #htmlize-codestudy-files

@16:53 Did some clean-up. I now need to start pre-planning htmlization #htmlize-codestudy-files

@16:55 Re-familiarizing myself with the schemas used here. #htmlize-codestudy-files
What does the schema look like? What kind of information does it have?
How do file names get translated into things "seen" by dagzet?
How to make sure file range links go to the right place?
All this and more... later...

@16:57 Attempt to quickly change the nose length like tract #voxbox-change-nose-length #timelog:00:23:10
This would be the quick and dirty approach, no interpolation.

@17:00 There is a lot of duplicate code between the tract and nose #voxbox-change-nose-length
Including this tract size behavior. I am ignoring that fact right
now.

@17:06 attempting to integrate with singer sliders demo #voxbox-change-nose-length

@17:11 Uh-oh. why is my JS code not working. I didn't do anything?
Oh okay. Just needed to clean some caching and rebuild.

@17:22 Things sound right in the example! #voxbox-change-nose-length
The velum now sounds more nasally everywhere pretty evenly.

@20:15 Attempt to sequence the first few bars of "Milowda" using vocal synthesizer
Found some sheet music. I want to hear how the sonorities sound.

@21:49 Got some initial milowda chords. Attached it to the file "milowda_chords.mp3"
