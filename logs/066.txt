@2024-07-24 Day 66.
16 days left of batch.
---
Prev: Dagzet initial commandset almost done,
but different strange things break when I try to use it.
The Trio voice manager mostly works except for that
one weird timing thing, which ain't bad.
---
Next: try to get rust dagzet working with my RC
knowledge grpah. investigate timing logic and think
about chords in Trio, 

@09:40 Later morning triage.

@09:51 This feels completed. #demo-trio-voice-scheduler #demo-trio-low-timing
There's one timing issue that I'm going to look at,
but that feels like another task.

@09:52 Description of timing issue #demo-trio-low-timing
Sometimes, when I put the pen down on the tablet,
the lower voice will wait an extra beat before
turning on. I can see in the window that the time
value becomes "1" twice, which I don't want to happen.
---
I think the issue here may have to do with how I am
handling clock resets. It's possible that I missed
something when I quickly add it in yesterday.

@10:04 Our little fella needs to enjoy themselves #poke-laughter-chitter
The sound could be done to facilitate this better.
But I also think the eyes should change from bug-eyed
to the kawaii "> <" eyes.
---
The graphics will be a faster change than the sounds,
so I may want to get started on that in the next
day or so

@10:11 A more sophisticated chord selection algorithm is required #demo-trio-chords #demo-trio
The issue is there is no sense of resolution anywhere.
It still kinda meanders.
