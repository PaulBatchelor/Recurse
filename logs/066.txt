@2024-07-24 Day 66. Initial Dagzet Rust Port Completed.
16 days left of batch.
---
Prev: Dagzet initial commandset almost done,
but different strange things break when I try to use it.
The Trio voice manager mostly works except for that
one weird timing thing, which ain't bad.
---
Next: try to get rust dagzet working with my RC
knowledge grpah. investigate timing logic and think
about chords in Trio.

@09:40 Later morning triage.

@09:51 This feels completed. #demo-trio-voice-scheduler #demo-trio-low-timing
There's one timing issue that I'm going to look at,
but that feels like another task.

@09:52 Description of timing issue #demo-trio-low-timing
Sometimes, when I put the pen down on the tablet,
the lower voice will wait an extra beat before
turning on. I can see in the window that the time
value becomes "1" twice, which I don't want to happen.
---
I think the issue here may have to do with how I am
handling clock resets. It's possible that I missed
something when I quickly add it in yesterday.

@10:04 Our little fella needs to enjoy themselves #poke-laughter-chitter
The sound could be done to facilitate this better.
But I also think the eyes should change from bug-eyed
to the kawaii "> <" eyes.
---
The graphics will be a faster change than the sounds,
so I may want to get started on that in the next
day or so

@10:11 A more sophisticated chord selection algorithm is required #demo-trio-chords #demo-trio
The issue is there is no sense of resolution anywhere.
It still kinda meanders.

@10:16 Publish

@10:27 More dagzet integration work #dagzet-rust #timelog:00:42:14

@10:34 I don't think I finished the topsort work #dagzet-rust

@11:09 topsort bug fixed. I just didn't finish writing #dagzet-rust
The test I had for it was too small.

@11:10 nice! running into invalid command error, which is what we want. #dagzet-rust

@11:11 Working on cx command. #dagzet-rust
"cx" is an external connection, and it allows you to make
connections to nodes that are external
---
A partial implementation of cx is all that is needed for now.
No aliases, no shorthands. It's all just full paths.
---
Any nodes used by =cx= get stored in a list (set?). When
unknown nodes are checked, if it can't find the node
in the locally created nodes, it'll check the nodes here.
---
Connections will work the same way since it utilizes a SQL
command. The burden is on the dagzetter to ensure that
nodes get created before they are connected with =cx=. This
is different from =co=, which follows a more declarative
style.

@11:38 set up tests for initila cx behavior #dagzet-rust

@11:50 now the implementation #dagzet-rust #timelog:01:40:38

@12:09 now to try and hook things up again #dagzet-rust

@12:12 In generate edges, I need to ignore external connections #dagzet-rust
At this point, any unknown nodes should have checked for.
---
Is there ever a situation where an edge would have an
unknown node missed by the unknown node error check?

@12:22 I think it works. One quick look around. #dagzet-rust

@12:24 Nope. Full page generation is causing a crash in genpage.lua #dagzet-rust
It's a sqlite error. I need to figure out what the error is.
---
I need to use =db:errmsg=
---
I didn't configure the column name correctly.

@12:34 More sqlite errors. I think I'm forgetting to name the columns #dagzet-rust

@12:36 The rest of the tables need to be implemented #dagzet-rust

@12:54 Running into a really odd stack overflow error #dagzet-rust
I'm going to have to call it quits after this.

@13:00 We are getting loops in the output. #dagzet-rust
It is random too, probably due to randomness in lua tables.
---
Something is going wrong in the SQLite table generation.
When I place debug prints in the =shortname= generator,
I get a ton of stuff.
===
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./tools/gendb.sh && ./tools/dz_wikigen.sh | cut -f 2 | sort | uniq -c | sort
#+END_SRC

@16:46 debugging #dagzet-rust #timelog:00:45:48
My goal is to take a look at the generated table outputs of both.

@17:00 number of nodes are consistent, name order is not #dagzet-rust
This is probably due to the randomized hashmap structure
in Rust.
---
But, the node IDs are the same, monotonically increasing
unique values.

@17:02 lines output is identical as well #dagzet-rust

@17:14 something is wrong with the connections #dagzet-rust
There seems to be duplicates. I generated and sorted
the connections alphabetically and found these.
---
The rust version also has inconsistent connections as well.

@17:18 connections: 127 rust dagzet vs 142 lua dagzet #dagzet-rust
It is consistently this. I wonder if "cx" is partially
to blame. disabling all the cxs now.

@17:21 connections are the same without cx. #dagzet-rust
There are 15 cx connections made, and that accounts for
the missing connections.

@17:22 I wonder if it's the edge generation somehow #dagzet-rust

@17:25 I think I should be doing a name lookup, not using the ID values directly #dagzet-rust

@17:30 Okay! that fixed the connections issues. #dagzet-rust
Now, let's see if the error goes away.

@17:32 FINALLY. IT WORKS. #dagzet-rust
I think I really mean it this time. It generates the
data without crashing and everything. Peaking around,
it seems to produce the data just fine.

@18:21 I have taken a break broadcast my success. Heading out now for dinner. #dagzet-rust

@20:14 More reading on machine language. #read-elem-compsys #timelog:00:45:17
