@2024-06-17 Day 29. Start of Week 5?
54 Days Left of Batch.
---
I am thinking about next week being the week I send my
laptop in for repair. I do have my other computer, a NUC
running Alpine Linux, but it's a very specialized
computer. I won't be able to do much web stuff, but
most Rust stuff will be fine.
---
Prev: More work on chord demo, studied VCV Rack Potential
code using annotation @!(dzref "codestudy/potential")!@,
set up code annotation tooling, React reading.
---
Next:

|| @!(taskref "vcv-potential-study")!@: wrap-up initial
review, follow up on TODOs made yesterday (dztodo).

|| @!(taskref "chords-demo")!@: Build out initial interactive demo
based on example.

|| @!(taskref "voxbox-tongue-interface")!@: re-work the tongue
control interface so it can work with arbitrary sizes.

|| @!(taskref "htmlize-codestudy-files")!@: begin work
on htmlizing code study files.

@07:28 Some morning reading #react-describing-ui #timelog:00:21:08

@07:55 Morning triage

@08:22 How to make this more actionable? #demo-react-UI
When I initially wrote this, I didn't really know what
it is I was talking about.
---
The goal here is to be able to use a NameBrand JS Framework
to get better at understanding how this tool works. I think
when I initially wrote this, I was imagining React to be
more of a widget library, when really it's more about
managing state of the widgets, and the widgets are
somewhere else.
---
Perhaps what I really want are some nice looking sliders
with CSS, and then using React to manage the state of these?

@08:38 Writing Zulip Check-in message

@09:05 Time to schedule an apple appoint for this screen. Sigh. Goodbye money.

@09:19 Well, I forgot the password to my apple ID again.
I don't have any other apple device, so this is a painful
experience. Do I even bother?

@09:59 Did some Zoom experiments on my Nuc
Surprisingly, it seems to work on Alpine for now. It's
nice to know that I can use that as an option in a pinch.

@10:01 Getting ready to go to hub.
