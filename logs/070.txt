@11:00 Implement upper/lower voice finder. #demo-trio-chords #timelog:00:09:43

@11:11 Plan out how to insert chords #demo-trio-chords #timelog:00:34:42

@11:41 I have built an initial "Chord Manager" #demo-trio-chords
I believe I have identified the entry points for
the chord manager in the existing code, and I have
built an initial dummy interface for it. There is
a failing test now with the methods.
---
If I can implement this interface, I think it'll be
ready for actual integration.

@11:47 Implementing chord manager #demo-trio-chords #timelog:00:49:00

@11:49 Populating the chord table. #demo-trio-chords

@12:22 Upper/lower movement could be different #demo-trio-chords
Upper/lower voice selection is based on minimal distance
from lead voice. This could also change to be based on
the minimal distance from the voice it is currently at
while also being above/below the lead.
---
Writing this down, I'm realizing there's potential for
chaos (an upper voice that somehow keeps drifting upwards,
for instance). Could be a cool thing though.

@12:36 tests seem to pass for the initial chord manager #demo-trio-chords

@12:37 Let's see if I can make this work #demo-trio-chords #timelog:00:17:39

@12:56 I want a minor VI in there #demo-trio-chords #timelog:00:20:00

@13:03 Harmonic continuinity is coming through, but better voice leading needed #demo-trio-chords
Also running into a bug with chord harmonies. I get
wrong chords. If I keep tapping on Do, I'll land on
sustained chords, which aren't correct.

@13:07 Oh right, I think I need to make sure duplicates are ignored #demo-trio-chords
Still not fixing the bug I described above.
The lower note is incorrectly holding onto the note of
the previous chord for some reason.

@13:16 Pulling myself away. #demo-trio-chords

@14:49 Fixing the weird initial chord bug #demo-trio-chords #timelog:00:07:32
Retriggering the lowest note causes it to alternate
between a major chord (correct) and a sustained chord (incorrect)
The upper note is correct, while the lower note is incorrect.

@14:59 It never chooses anything but the top 2 right now #demo-trio-chords

@15:06 Minimal movement, and better choices #demo-trio-chords #timelog:00:19:50
The state transitions aren't shuffling through the
states as well as I'd like. Also, there's too much unnecessary
voice movement.
---
How can the system choose interesting chords and also minimize
movement?
---
Specifically: I want the system to be introduced to the minor
4 (without resorting to randomness), and I want the voices
to resolve in an expected way.
---
It is a constraint problem. Each voice has different behavior.
---
Upper voice should move as little as possible while still
being above the lead voice.
---
Lower voice should move the minimum number of steps
required to complete the chord, based on what the current
upper and lead pitches are.
---
New heuristic idea: of the candidates, choose the least
used chord so far. Probably keep a running heat map. This
solves the chord selection problem, but not the voice
leading issue
---
Another heuristic for chord selection is to find
a candidate chord that requires the least amount
of movement, given the current upper/lower pitches.
This would require storing the current pitches of upper/lower,
calculating the upper/lower pitches for each chord, and
getting the combined step change for each chord.
The one with the lowest score wins.
---
These are two different heuristics for selection, and
I can imagine there would be a way to choose one over
the other.

@15:27 Implement the "least used chord" heuristic #demo-trio-chords #timelog:00:58:01

@16:24 Heuristic implemented in tests, now to try it out #demo-trio-chords #timelog:00:09:35

@16:36 Least Movement Heuristic thoughts, test building #demo-trio-chords
Least movement: for each candidates, get the working
upper and lower notes of those chords given the current
lead pitch. Get the absolute differences between those
and the current lower/upper. The one with the lowest
score wins.
---
A good hybrid could be something called "Lazy Least Used".
Go for the least used, but only if the movement required
is under a certain score. Otherwise, choose the one with
least movement

@16:42 Working out a least movement test. #demo-trio-chords #timelog:00:18:34
Firstly, make sure the low-level chord measurement mechanics
are in place and working properly. Then, simulate a chord change.

@16:57 Implement measure movement core logic #demo-trio-chords #timelog:00:04:33

@17:02 Work out least movement heuristic test #demo-trio-chords #timelog:00:23:06

@17:10 Staggered voices complicate things #demo-trio-chords
You need to store what the pitch actually is
somewhat reliably. There isn't currently a caching
mechanism in place for this.
---
The entry points for this happen when a pitch is actually
scheduled.

@17:20 What happens if you schedule a note that is the same? #demo-trio-chords
Minimal movement means lots of situations where a note
stays the same.
---
Shouldn't really matter, for now. It'll cause more complication
if a check is introduced (for example, handle what happens
if there is no previous note).

@17:26 Implement least movement heuristic #demo-trio-chords #timelog:00:23:20

@17:50 Hook it up into the system #demo-trio-chords #timelog:00:19:03

@18:05 why is it crashing now? #demo-trio-chords

@18:21 It works! Next steps #demo-trio-chords
Lazy Least Frequent Heuristic, Y-axis expression.
---
Nice thing to have: some way to go from staggered to
instantaneous behavior.
