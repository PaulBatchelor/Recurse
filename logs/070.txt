@11:00 Implement upper/lower voice finder. #demo-trio-chords #timelog:00:09:43

@11:11 Plan out how to insert chords #demo-trio-chords #timelog:00:34:42

@11:41 I have built an initial "Chord Manager" #demo-trio-chords
I believe I have identified the entry points for
the chord manager in the existing code, and I have
built an initial dummy interface for it. There is
a failing test now with the methods.
---
If I can implement this interface, I think it'll be
ready for actual integration.

@11:47 Implementing chord manager #demo-trio-chords #timelog:00:49:00

@11:49 Populating the chord table. #demo-trio-chords

@12:22 Upper/lower movement could be different #demo-trio-chords
Upper/lower voice selection is based on minimal distance
from lead voice. This could also change to be based on
the minimal distance from the voice it is currently at
while also being above/below the lead.
---
Writing this down, I'm realizing there's potential for
chaos (an upper voice that somehow keeps drifting upwards,
for instance). Could be a cool thing though.

@12:36 tests seem to pass for the initial chord manager #demo-trio-chords

@12:37 Let's see if I can make this work #demo-trio-chords #timelog:00:17:39

@12:56 I want a minor VI in there #demo-trio-chords #timelog:00:20:00

@13:03 Harmonic continuinity is coming through, but better voice leading needed #demo-trio-chords
Also running into a bug with chord harmonies. I get
wrong chords. If I keep tapping on Do, I'll land on
sustained chords, which aren't correct.

@13:07 Oh right, I think I need to make sure duplicates are ignored #demo-trio-chords
Still not fixing the bug I described above.
The lower note is incorrectly holding onto the note of
the previous chord for some reason.

@13:16 Pulling myself away. #demo-trio-chords

@14:49 Fixing the weird initial chord bug #demo-trio-chords
Retriggering the lowest note causes it to alternate
between a major chord (correct) and a sustained chord (incorrect)
The upper note is correct, while the lower note is incorrect.
