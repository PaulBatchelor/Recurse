52 Days Left of Batch.

I'm feeling a little bit of pain in my right arm, so I
am going to be limiting my computer time today. More reading
today, I think.
---
Prev: Initial code for OSC controlled voxbox, more
chords on vocal chords demo. Did not get to HTMLizing
codestudy stuff, tongue control in voxbox, or any reading.
---
Next: Finish up initial VoxBoxOSC MVP, React reading,
make the chord demo look a bit nicer (maybe?)

@08:30 Morning Triage

@08:50 Work on Zulip Checkin

@09:06 Okay. Going for a walk. Maybe shopping.

@11:20 Oops that was a longer walk than expected.
I accidentally wandered onto a movie set in the
historical district of Brooklyn and stayed and watched.
They gave me a water bottle, so now I'm part
of the Movie Industry now.

@11:34 Shopping for food
