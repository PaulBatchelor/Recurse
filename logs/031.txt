52 Days Left of Batch.

I'm feeling a little bit of pain in my right arm, so I
am going to be limiting my computer time today. More reading
today, I think.
---
Prev: Initial code for OSC controlled voxbox, more
chords on vocal chords demo. Did not get to HTMLizing
codestudy stuff, tongue control in voxbox, or any reading.
---
Next: Finish up initial VoxBoxOSC MVP, React reading,
make the chord demo look a bit nicer (maybe?)

@08:30 Morning Triage

@08:50 Work on Zulip Checkin

@09:06 Okay. Going for a walk. Maybe shopping.

@11:20 Oops that was a longer walk than expected.
I accidentally wandered onto a movie set in the
historical district of Brooklyn and stayed and watched.
They gave me a water bottle, so now I'm part
of the Movie Industry now.

@11:34 Shopping for food

@13:18 Get OSC messages to actually control stuff #voxboxOSC
In rust, this might be slightly difficult with how I
am currently arranging things because I have my OSC listener
component separated from the DSP component. Ideally, I'd
like to have the DSP be a reference inside the OSC component,
but that may be tricky.

@14:35 We are leaking memory #voxboxOSC
Because the main loop in C, I'm leaking memory when I
allocate the DSP object.

@14:40 Wait I figured out how to free it unsafely! #voxboxOSC
It involves calling =unsafe{Box::from_raw()}= and then
=drop=.

@14:53 okay pitch control works from OSC. Taking a break from this #voxboxOSC #timelog:01:08:19

@15:34 How does sourcehut handle source code highlighting #htmlize-codestudy-files #timelog:00:51:30
Initial extraction and studies in =scratch/lines_css/=.

@16:49 Let's see if I can improve the CSS of the buttons #chords-demo
