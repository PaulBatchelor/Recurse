@2024-06-26 Day 37.
45 days left of batch.

My social battery is pretty drained, to be honest. It was
a difficult day/night for me yesterday. Didn't sleep well.
It's important to me that I push myself to keep showing up
and interacting with people. I'm realizing that "working at
the edge of your abilities" doesn't necessarily mean
technical abilities.

Prev: codestudy, planning, lots of hub activities.

Next:

|| @!(taskref "provision-thinkpad")!@: my laptop came yesterday!
Going to pick it up and provision it today.

|| @!(taskref "htmlize-codestudy-files")!@: still need more time
on this.

|| @!(taskref "what-now-week6")!@: commit some brainstorms
to tasks.

@09:14 Morning Triage

@09:25 Prototyping the initial game using p5 is probably a good move #bucket-initial-scoping
Other than the sound engine working, getting the drawing
pipeline working feels like it'll be the most time consuming
thing. I don't know if I want to spend my time doing that.

@09:35 Writing out zulip check-in.

@09:47 Trying out mini-wasm-renderer
See @!(dzref "webdev/wasm/mini_wasm_renderer")!@.

It works!
