@2024-06-26 Day 37.
45 days left of batch.
---
My social battery is pretty drained, to be honest. It was
a difficult day/night for me yesterday. Didn't sleep well.
It's important to me that I push myself to keep showing up
and interacting with people. I'm realizing that "working at
the edge of your abilities" doesn't necessarily mean
technical abilities.
---
Prev: codestudy, planning, lots of hub activities.
---
Next:

|| @!(taskref "provision-thinkpad")!@: my laptop came yesterday!
Going to pick it up and provision it today.

|| @!(taskref "htmlize-codestudy-files")!@: still need more time
on this.

|| @!(taskref "what-now-week6")!@: commit some brainstorms
to tasks.

@09:14 Morning Triage

@09:25 Prototyping the initial game using p5 is probably a good move #bucket-initial-scoping
Other than the sound engine working, getting the drawing
pipeline working feels like it'll be the most time consuming
thing. I don't know if I want to spend my time doing that.

@09:35 Writing out zulip check-in.

@09:47 Trying out mini-wasm-renderer
See @!(dzref "webdev/wasm/mini_wasm_renderer")!@.
---
It works!

@09:54 Attempt to pick up my thinkpad laptop #provision-thinkpad

@10:07 Laptop turns on. Good. Now to get Alpine image downloaded and installed #provision-thinkpad

@12:04 I have a decent enough system now

@12:18 Working on getting nmcli configured
Using the alpine wiki

@12:26 networkmanager service stops when I try to list wifi networks
I need to figure out how to troubleshoot this
---
It's in /var/log/messages I think, tailing now.
---
I can get more verbose output with =service networkmanager start -v=

@12:35 rebooting

@12:37 Okay nmcli can list devices now, attempting to connect
I get an "not authorized to control networking message",
which is a known thing in the Alpine wiki. There is
a config file I make:

===
#+BEGIN_SRC ini
[main]
auth-polkit=false
#+END_SRC
===

@12:42 we have a connection!

@12:43 Going to run over to the hub and try to connect this thing to their WiFi
I will feel pretty much accomplished by then.

@13:30 (approx.) Lunch

@15:19 OLED black figured out, back and forth

@15:45 Re-acquainting myself with last progress. Final remaining bits with any luck #htmlize-codestudy-files #timelog:00:23:06

@16:05 The CSS works, now the links need to be hooked up into the HTMLized output #htmlize-codestudy-files #timelog:00:15:43

@16:22 Test it out on website. #htmlize-codestudy-files #timelog:00:18:43

@16:32 Why are nodes missing in "potential" codestudy? #bug-missing-nodes
For example nodes like "cpp" and "magsign_cpp" are missing.
---
It's not being added to the data.
===
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
jq .nodes[] | .name data/codestudy/potential/index.json | grep magsign_cpp
#+END_SRC
===
It *is* showing up in the SQLite table. So the problem is
in =generate_graph_data.lua=.
===
#+BEGIN_SRC sqlite
SELECT name FROM dz_nodes WHERE name like "%cpp"
#+END_SRC
