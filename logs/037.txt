Did you know Philip Glass used to be a plumber?

Prev: "A Blob Named Bucket" planning, reflect on RC time so
far, C creatures, Reading.

Next:

|| @!(taskref "htmlize-codestudy-files")!@: Did not
do yesterday. Try to tackle this before leaving for Hub.

|| @!(taskref "bucket-initial-scoping")!@: Did some brainstorming,
now I want to work out some actionable items.

|| Lots of RC things today: Webdev Meetup, Audio Hang,
Graphics Hang, Half Baked Demos

@09:29 Morning Triage.
Late start. Ironically, I was trying to wake up earlier,
but it backfired.

@09:32 I need to do less. #what-now-week6
There is always the temptation to bite off more than
one can chew, and once again I feel like this is starting
to happen. I'll probably want to leave this up for
the rest of the week and see if any more thoughts emerge.

@09:36 Make tiny games before this small game #bucket-initial-scoping
I want to build demos exploring a some of the core "verbs" I wrote down,
like "poke", "eat", "move (to target). Probably in p5. Sound
design would be a great thing to garnish it with after. Sound
design will be another task too.

@09:56 Zulip Checkin

@10:02 Initial refactoring attempt of my weewiki system #htmlize-codestudy-files #timelog:01:04:09
Basically, there are default header/footer functions for
HTML pages. I need to rework this so that the dagzet files
use their own custom header/footer functions.
---
Does weewiki store the current page name somewhere? Yes,
it's =ww-name=.
---
I'm going with global mutable state, because that's ultimately
going to be easier.
---
Oh boy, this is tricky. By the time the Org gets parsed,
the headers/footers are already set up. This means I
can't actually disable the templates from the Org file
itself. It needs to come from a lower level.
---
I can add the files to a list, but that's error prone.
---
Okay, files are going to have the "dzfiles" or perhaps
"dzf" extension for terseness. So for example, a file
called =codestudy/potential/mag_sign.rs= would have
a prefix of =dzf/codestudy/potential/mag_sign.rs=.
My weewiki server would then be able to filter those
pages and disable templates entirely. So far this is the
best hack I got.
---
testing out hacky idea
---
Initial idea working. I'll need to inject the rest of the
HTML next.

@10:03 Oh wow my laptop is coming today gotta pick that up.
