@09:29 Morning Triage.
Late start. Ironically, I was trying to wake up earlier,
but it backfired.

@09:32 I need to do less. #what-now-week6
There is always the temptation to bite off more than
one can chew, and once again I feel like this is starting
to happen. I'll probably want to leave this up for
the rest of the week and see if any more thoughts emerge.

@09:36 Make tiny games before this small game #bucket-initial-scoping
I want to build demos exploring a some of the core "verbs" I wrote down,
like "poke", "eat", "move (to target). Probably in p5. Sound
design would be a great thing to garnish it with after. Sound
design will be another task too.
