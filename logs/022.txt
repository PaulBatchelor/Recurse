@2024-06-10 Day 22.
61 days until the end of my batch (August 10th)
---
Prev: Velum/Nasal debugging. Some demos involving
overtone throat singing. Some initial preset work.
---
Next: Preset Import in demo, read up on React, scope out
initial Gesture Synthesizer Generator components in Rust.

@08:15 Morning Triage

@08:27 Oscillator may be less important at this point... #implement-osc
Originally, the idea was to use this is a proof of concept
for the WAV writer. Things have moved forward without needing
this.
---
LFOs are still a thing that would be nice to have though,
so I'll keep that in mind.

@08:29 rephasor sometime this week? #implement-rephasor
Thinking about building a simple gesture signal generator
in Rust this week.

@08:30 gesture path would be nice this week #implement-gesture-path

@08:33 should start my React-ing #react-tic-tac-toe
