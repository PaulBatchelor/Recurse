@2024-06-10 Day 22. Preset import. React tic-tac-toe.
61 days until the end of my batch (August 10th)
---
Prev: Velum/Nasal debugging. Some demos involving
overtone throat singing. Some initial preset work.
---
Next: Preset Import in demo, read up on React, scope out
initial Gesture Synthesizer Generator components in Rust.

@08:15 Morning Triage

@08:27 Oscillator may be less important at this point... #implement-osc
Originally, the idea was to use this is a proof of concept
for the WAV writer. Things have moved forward without needing
this.
---
LFOs are still a thing that would be nice to have though,
so I'll keep that in mind.

@08:29 rephasor sometime this week? #implement-rephasor
Thinking about building a simple gesture signal generator
in Rust this week.

@08:30 gesture path would be nice this week #implement-gesture-path

@08:33 should start my React-ing #react-tic-tac-toe

@09:10 Just finished my zulip check-in

@09:15 boot up linux box, get internet working

@09:58 import ink from previous weeks.

@10:14 ink added to git repo and pushed to github.

@10:30 Get ready to go to RC.

@11:05 Unblock and reflect workshop

@12:00 Lunch

@14:02 planning what to work on

@14:14 scope out preset importing functionality #quick-preset-export
The thing that makes this difficult is that I want
the UI elements to update with the internal state. I'd need
to build something out to do this.
---
What's a quick way to get this done?

@14:20 setting up some boilerplate, which is as far as I can see right now #quick-preset-export

@14:32 Looks like I can simulate events. #quick-preset-export
[[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35659430/how-do-i-programmatically-trigger-an-input-event-without-jquery]]

@14:52 Okay, grokking this better. #quick-preset-export
I need to set the slider from JS, then fire off an input
event to set the rest of the parameters.

@15:03 Glottal controls work, now regions #quick-preset-export
A little bit more challenging, since those sliders are made
an older way. Hopefully I an refactor this so all the sliders
are made the same way.

@15:32 Okay it works #quick-preset-export
I suddenly ran into some weird issues with the textarea
=textContent= value, so I changed it to be =value= instead.

@15:34 so textContent is not a textarea property but a DOM node property? #quick-preset-export
See: @!(dzref "webdev/textcontent_mdn")!@.

I am not sure how it was working all this time then suddenly
not working.

@15:43 Uploaded to website #quick-preset-export

@15:52 Tic Tac Toe Tutorial #react-tick-tac-toe

@15:55 damn, distracted by trying to get a draw game #react-tic-tac-toe
It took a few tries, ended up looking up a draw.

@15:57 Okay back on track #react-tic-tac-toe

@16:27 Packing up early. getting very sleepy #react-tic-tac-toe
