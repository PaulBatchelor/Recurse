Prev: Impossible day! I worked with JB to attempt to
implement some audio-reactive effects in Swift. There was
no time to do the FPGA stuff I had in mind.

Next: Finish up react tutorial @!(taskref
"react-tic-tac-toe")!@, start reading the
follow-up @!(task "react-thinking-in-react")!@, start
working implementing on the rephasor in Rust.
