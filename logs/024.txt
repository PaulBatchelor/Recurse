@2024-06-12 Day 24. Implemented rephasor. Hack the Planet!
59 days left of batch.
---
Prev: Impossible day! I worked with JB to attempt to
implement some audio-reactive effects in Swift. There was
no time to do the FPGA stuff I had in mind.
---
Next: Finish up react tutorial @!(taskref
"react-tic-tac-toe")!@, start reading the
follow-up @!(taskref "react-thinking-in-react")!@, start
working implementing on the rephasor in Rust.

@08:00 Morning triage

@08:21 Researching VCVRack + Rust plugins #voxbox-vcv
See: @!(dzref "rust/potential_vcv")!@.

@08:29 Uh-oh, janet bug in my day 23 logs
Okay fixed. Glad that was an easy one.

@08:31 Ready to publish, writing up Zulip check-in

@08:57 Adding my react code up to this point to git #react-tic-tac-toe

@09:28 React extension works now! #react-tic-tac-toe
I probably needed to restart the browser.

@09:57 Got slightly distracted on Zulip finding things related to career
See: @!(dzref "career/system_design_primer")!@
and @!(dzref "career/interactive_coding_challenges")!@.

@10:12 Completed tutorial #react-tic-tac-toe
There are some follow-ups that I'm probably not going to do.

@13:30 Pre-rephasor work #implement-rephasor

@13:33 Working on rephasor on my linux box yay #implement-rephasor

@13:34 Going to try out a new thing with how to log times
Going to start a stop watch, and then somehow use the tag
system here to log a duration with the event as the
start time.

@13:35 Beginning initial work #implement-rephasor #timelog:01:00:00

@13:37 Boilerplate code from phasor #implement-rephasor

@13:38 Copy over rephasor struct from sndkit #implement-rephasor

@13:53 Building out initial example #implement-rephasor

@14:37 Initial implementation with example done #implement-rephasor

@14:40 Back to the Hub.
