@2024-06-12 Day 24.
59 days left of batch.
---
Prev: Impossible day! I worked with JB to attempt to
implement some audio-reactive effects in Swift. There was
no time to do the FPGA stuff I had in mind.
---
Next: Finish up react tutorial @!(taskref
"react-tic-tac-toe")!@, start reading the
follow-up @!(task "react-thinking-in-react")!@, start
working implementing on the rephasor in Rust.

@08:00 Morning triage

@08:21 Researching VCVRack + Rust plugins #voxbox-vcv
See: @!(dzref "rust/potential_vcv")!@.

@08:29 Uh-oh, janet bug in my day 23 logs
Okay fixed. Glad that was an easy one.

@08:31 Ready to publish, writing up Zulip check-in

@08:57 Adding my react code up to this point to git #react-tic-tac-toe

@09:28 React extension works now! #react-tic-tac-toe
I probably needed to restart the browser.

@09:57 Got slightly distracted on Zulip finding things related to career
See: @!(career/system_design_primer)!@
and @!(career/interactive_coding_challenges)!@.

@10:12 Completed tutorial #react-tic-tac-toe
There are some follow-ups that I'm probably not going to do.
