@11:20 (Late) Morning Triage

@11:27 initial demo done. Follow-up? #demo-poke #consider-poke-follow-up
I've gotten good feedback from people, and was
really interested in watching people interact
with it. It's apparently has startled many cats!
I may want to scope out some follow-up improvemnts
to this, if there's time. Some things include:
wall collision sounds, more dynamic interactions
when poking, more variation in sound, and
more empathy mechanics (feeding, laughter/tickling,
etc).

@11:33 final week7 career thoughts. #what-now-week7
It's been nice getting most of my resume
structured as data. It's very "music tech" oriented,
with a strong emphasis on DSP and "low-level" languages
like C/C++. For some reason, I didn't expect for
a narrative like that to so strongly emerge.
I could probably find enjoyment in "systems" oriented
things: studying databases, OSes, computer architecture,
etc. Rust seems like a good way to stay relevant
in these fields.
---
I think the leetcode is going to resume next week.
If I can find time every day, I could do about
30 leetcode problems before this batch is over.
But, leetcode takes more time than people think.
An hour of focused time is quite valuable. If I
can work my way up to 2 every day, that's most of
LC-75 (80%). If I do 2 every other day, and at least
one every day, that's about 45, or 60%
of LC-75.
---
I want to get typescript under my belt. The
handbook @!(dzref "webdev/typescript_handbook")!@ is
a little under 40 pages, so probably something I
could feasibly read. Then again, maybe it's just good
enough to throw up some sliders in React and
just bump around typescript that way? How
much of my time is it worth?
---
Maybe if I can get neovim up and running, I
think I may have a better time doing webdev stuff and
feeling "modern"? (He says while typing in
a very vanilla vim editor in termux running
on Alpine linux using vintage IBM colors.)
---
But damn, get this resume built up and send it off
to Jobs Chat already jeez.

@12:18 Publishing

@12:20 Let's see how easy this "kickstart" thing is. #investigate-kickstart-neovim #timelog:00:51:20

@12:41 It seems to be working. Some sort of LSP is installed I think, but I want autocomplete #investigate-kickstart-neovim

@12:42 Attempting to install YouCompleteMe #investigate-kickstart-neovim

@12:45 Wait wait, I think there's another way to get rust analyzer working using nvim-lspconfig #investigate-kickstart-neovim

@13:02 Okay it works. Kinda neat. Trying to get typescript set up #investigate-kickstart-neovim
It works!

@13:14 epilogue #investigate-kickstart-neovim #timelog:00:05:40
Key things I did to get things working:
---
Clone the kickstart repo to =~/.config/nvim=. That is to
say, the repo becomes the folder "nvim" as your base
config. Opening up nvim does the rest.
---
the =init.lua= file in =nvim= is chock full of comments
and README stuff. I searched and skimmed around for
ways to turn on =rust-analyzer= with =lsp-config=, it
was a line I had to uncomment.
---
Also had to uncomment a line to include new plugins,
like the typescript neovim plugin I found. Installing
stuff through this plugin manager thing called =Lazy=
is basically a matter of appending table values
to the return table value in =lua/custom/plugins/init.lua=.
Opening up nvim handles installing stuff.
---
the LSP also does autoformatting. It *will* touch your
files once they are opened, so note to self be sure
to commit the files before doing anything when they
are opened in neovim for the first time.

@15:59 Back to the hub. Now what.

@16:00 Work out initial TeX backend based on cv.tex #resume-setup #timelog:00:43:48

@16:47 play with the LED sign here in hub #LEDsign #timelog:00:12:27
oscsend did not work. But: HACK THE PLANET

@18:44 now what.

@18:48 Add glottis parameters. #demo-react-UI #timelog:00:18:50

@19:08 Now for the region sliders #demo-react-UI #timelog:00:12:18

@19:20 Sliders React demo is currently 600kb #how-big-are-react-apps
Did this by running =npm run build= then examining
size of "build" directory.
---
By comparison, my vanilla JS project was only 12kb.

@19:44 Initial importing of webaudio stuff #demo-react-UI #timelog:00:32:39
