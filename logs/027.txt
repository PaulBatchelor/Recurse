@2024-06-15 Day 27.
56 days left of batch.
---
prev: read up on react, finished implementing linear gesture
path algorithm, got potential VCV plugin to compile and run,
messed around with midinous with Dan and Scott.
---
next:
@!(taskref "voxbox-size-control")!@: experiment with realtime
tract size control.
@!(taskref "react-describing-ui")!@: read more from the
"describing the UI" chapter from React website.
@!(taskref "voxbox-linear-gestsure-demo")!@: create a linear
gesture webaudio demo from the "tom's diner" example I made
yesterday.
@!(taskref "create-time-log-format")!@: start building out workable
code

@10:00 Morning triage. #timelog 00:00

@10:14 Chords demo could benefit from having interactive tract size. #chords-demo #voxbox-size-control
The issue with the chords at the moment is that the voice
parts don't sound right, which I think is due to the shapes
being wrong. If I am able to tune the size along with the
shape, I think I'll end up with better sounding results.

@10:20 Thinking about reworking the timelog format here. #create-time-log-log
Right now the syntax is =#timelog mm:ss=, but if we include
the time in the tag like =#timelog:mm:ss=, SQLite would be
able to parse it.

@10:23 uh-oh, segfault from yesterday's logs

@10:27 Okay it works again
I forgot to close out an inline Janet expression.
