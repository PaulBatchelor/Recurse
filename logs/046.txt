Next:

|| @!(taskref "create-chatter-sounds")!@: In the example,
add poke interactions, somehow.

|| @!(taskref "demo-poke")!@: Add eyes and mouth.

|| @!(taskref "how-big-are-react-apps")!@: Figure out,
how big are these react apps when exported?

|| @!(taskref "investigate-kickstart-neovim")!@: See how
far I can go getting kickstart to work with neovim.

@08:32 Morning Triage.
Starting this at home on my Mac.

@09:01 Poke interactions in chatter: thoughts. #demo-poke
The offline example should have some parts that will
eventually be designed to be modulated by user input (poking).
Poking can be simulating using a triggered gate. The gate
would go into an envelope (envelopes?) of some sort as way
to shape things like fundamental pitch and jitter.

@09:05 Eyes and mouth thoughts #demo-poke
Basically, my source of inspiration for this one are
those poptart commercials that were around during
the early 2000s @!(dzref "demos/poptarts")!@
---
It'd be nice to get collision working for the eyes, because
I think they will bulge out of the face occasionally.

Mouth shape needs to be flexible enough to support
mouth shapes. I want these to be synchronized with
the mouth shapes being synthesized by the audio.

@09:12 Trying to look into this today #investigate-kickstart-neovim

@09:13 I would like to have a working demo by EOD Friday (tomorrow) #demo-poke

@09:14 Publishing logs from yesterday

@09:29 I really need to focus and get this done by EOD Friday #resume-setup
I keep procrastinating and yak-shaving on this.
