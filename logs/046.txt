Next:

|| @!(taskref "create-chatter-sounds")!@: In the example,
add poke interactions, somehow.

|| @!(taskref "demo-poke")!@: Add eyes and mouth.

|| @!(taskref "how-big-are-react-apps")!@: Figure out,
how big are these react apps when exported?

|| @!(taskref "investigate-kickstart-neovim")!@: See how
far I can go getting kickstart to work with neovim.

@08:32 Morning Triage.
Starting this at home on my Mac.

@09:01 Poke interactions in chatter: thoughts. #demo-poke
The offline example should have some parts that will
eventually be designed to be modulated by user input (poking).
Poking can be simulating using a triggered gate. The gate
would go into an envelope (envelopes?) of some sort as way
to shape things like fundamental pitch and jitter.

@09:05 Eyes and mouth thoughts #demo-poke
Basically, my source of inspiration for this one are
those poptart commercials that were around during
the early 2000s @!(dzref "demos/poptarts")!@
---
It'd be nice to get collision working for the eyes, because
I think they will bulge out of the face occasionally.
---
Mouth shape needs to be flexible enough to support
mouth shapes. I want these to be synchronized with
the mouth shapes being synthesized by the audio.

@09:12 Trying to look into this today #investigate-kickstart-neovim

@09:13 I would like to have a working demo by EOD Friday (tomorrow) #demo-poke

@09:14 Publishing logs from yesterday

@09:29 I really need to focus and get this done by EOD Friday #resume-setup
I keep procrastinating and yak-shaving on this.

@10:04 Adding tgate. #demo-poke #timelog:00:19:46

@10:24 Creating metro #demo-poke #timelog:00:06:45
This will drive the tgate. This can be made from a phasor.
Any time the phasor resets, produce a trigger.
---
Created a phasor to trigger utility called PhasorTrig

@10:32 Initial test of tgate in chatter example #demo-poke #timelog:00:10:10
Actually, I'm building out a metro that combines phasor
and phasortrig.

@10:42 I want an envelope now. #demo-poke #timelog:00:26:20
I will opt to port the envelope I made in sndkit.

@11:10 Initial envelope code ported. Now to see if it works. #demo-poke #timelog:00:07:16

@11:13 Loud distored noises (it didn't work). investigating #demo-poke
Now it works. Forgot to add the =exp= and update =pgate=.

@11:30 Lunch

@13:34 Refactoring chatter, getting it ready for poke. #demo-poke #timelog:00:42:36
Chatter sound needs to be consolidated into a struct
rather than in a main function. There also needs to be
a poke method, which will eventually be the thing called
when the user pokes the circle on the screen.

@13:35 At this point, the base chatter sounds have been made #create-chatter-sounds #demo-poke
So I think this task can be considered completed. The rest
of the sound design work will be polish for the poke demo.

@14:16 Fully encapsulated chatter into struct #create-chatter-sounds #demo-poke

@14:17 Now, to implement poke method #demo-poke #timelog:00:12:11
Up to this point, "poking" has been simulating using a
metro object. This metro needs to be pulled out of the
struct, and replaced with a gate fed into a threshold
generator. The metro function will exist outside, and when
it ticks an impulse, it will call the poke method. The
poke method will flip a gate signal on and off. Inside
ChatterBox, it will detect changes in the gate and turn
those into triggers like before.

@15:27 Making sure graphics work on my mac #demo-poke #timelog:00:01:34

@15:29 Connecting sound to graphics. #demo-poke #timelog:00:17:55
It works! It's a coarse experience, but it sorta works.

@15:56 Trying out on Android. #demo-poke #timelog:00:03:15
termux is awesome, because I can run it locally on my
phone.
---
It works. definitely needs some refinement. But a good enough
stopping point.

@16:22 Add "tap to begin" mechanic #demo-poke #timelog:30:12

@17:06 Debugging tap to begin on mobile #demo-poke

@17:15 Attempting to SSH #demo-poke #timelog:00:16:55

@18:14 Maybe a div/canvas onClick event handler will work? #demo-poke #timelog:00:06:17
Okay that works! Nice.
