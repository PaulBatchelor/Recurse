Planning next demo.

next:

|| @!(taskref "LC75")!@: Begin leetcode today I guess?

|| @!(taskref "investigate-tic80-audio")!@: Get
a better sense how the audio callback works, then
create follow-ups.

|| @!(taskref "demo-react-UI")!@: continue getting
WebAudio code ported to typescript.

|| @!(taskref "resume-setup")!@: Finishing touches
I swear.

|| @!(taskref "consider-poke-follow-up")!@: Create
some feasible tasks today.

Ears have been quite blocked this weekend. Still
blocked today.

@08:03 Morning triage

@08:15 Leetcode task created. #LC75

@08:17 Try to get project links working today #resume-setup
Timebox it to about 30 minutes. Give it one last
look, then send it to Jobs Chat.

@08:18 Downgrading shape morphing #voxbox-shape-morphing
The approach here isn't interactive enough, and I
think I need to keep focusing on interaction. I'd
rather have one mediocre vowel shape and interaction
than several excellent vowel shapes and no interaction.

@08:27 GOing to try to make some follow-up poke tasks today  #consider-poke-follow-up

@08:29 Been thinking a lot about the mechanics of this over the last few days #concept-concerto
Things involving Gesture mechanics. Specifically,
the concept of getting some kind of "auto-accompaniment"
to work with Gesture signal generator systems. Something
something event scheduler. Might be good to write some
things down.

@08:32 Writing better error handling for gendb

@09:01 Phew. Okay. Now, we can publish.

@09:10 TIC-80 investigations part 2. #investigate-tic80-audio #timelog:01:017:34
@09:19 8-bit audio. #investigate-tic80-audio
I shouldn't be terribly surprised by this, but the
output is 8-bit.

@09:24 8khz 8-bit singing vocals don't sound too terrible
Tested on my linear gesture demo using SoX.
The darker sound actually works favorably for this
synthesizer.
---
Converting to LPC10 (via sox), however, sucks.
The pitch is wrong.

@09:48 second-guessing myself on the 8-bit depth #investigate-tic80-audio
It could be that that's just a raw byte format.
The sound code here is fairly involved. I'm
going to need to look at this more.


@09:50 Unclear what is a buffer and what is a tick #investigate-tic80-audio
It is unclear to me when things are computing a single
sample of audio (tick), and when it's writing to
a buffer.
---
For example, SOKOL seems to be writing shorts (16-bit).
---
What I do know is that samples eventually show up in
something called "product->samples.buffer", but
I cannot find that definition yet (there's a lot
of macro magic in this repo). There is also a buffer
count too. It appears that these could be interleaved
samples.

@10:20 So much is implicitly defined #investigate-tic80-audio
As far as I can tell, =product.samples= is dynamically
generated. It's not actually anywhere in a struct.
The =tic80= stuct I have yet to actually find.
Same goes for =product.samples.buffer= and
=product.samples.count=. 
---
There are two top audio callbacks that tell tic80 to
generate soud (how much sound not sure? but it's
definitely multi-channel). I'm looking at
the one sokol uses called =studio_sound=. This
calls =tic_core_synth_sound()=, which I assume
writes to =product.samples.buffer= somehow.
If I can inject an effects processor right after
the buffer is fully written, I think that can be
enough for me.

@10:30 =runPcm()= and =stereo_synthesize()= are things to look at #investigate-tic80-audio
These calls seem to happen right before they
are resampled.

@11:00 Lunch

@12:00 Talk with Chirag

@13:00 C Creatures

@14:38 Play with Carsten's drawing tablet #drawing-tablet-experiments
Can it work on linux okay? I can I use libevdev with it?

@14:40 It works out of the box #drawing-tablet-experiments

@14:45 Oh wow, you can use this one as a touch pad too!
It even does touch to click this is incredible.

@14:51 Working through some evdev sample code I found online

@15:13 Initial polling program working! #drawing-tablet-experiments
X max: 21600, Y max: 13500, Physical units: 8.5 x 6 inches,
---
Along the Y-axis, this evenly comes too 2250 pixels/inch.
The X axis is about 2541.1764. Huh.

@15:24 How to turn off wacom touchpad (in sway)?

@15:49 After some googling and JQ-ing, got both pen and finger disabled #timelog:01:09:42
They still work in my test poller.

@15:59 Quick attempt at project links #resume-setup #timelog:00:20:06
I think I already have URL code in the TeX code?
---
oops maybe not

@16:27 React Reading: Scaling up with Reducer and Context #react-managing-state #timelog:00:20:48
This concludes the "managing state" chapter.

@18:42 Some "staggered voice" system design planning #concept-concerto #timelog:00:32:48
