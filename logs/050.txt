blocked today.

@08:03 Morning triage

@08:15 Leetcode task created. #LC75

@08:17 Try to get project links working today #resume-setup
Timebox it to about 30 minutes. Give it one last
look, then send it to Jobs Chat.

@08:18 Downgrading shape morphing #voxbox-shape-morphing
The approach here isn't interactive enough, and I
think I need to keep focusing on interaction. I'd
rather have one mediocre vowel shape and interaction
than several excellent vowel shapes and no interaction.

@08:27 GOing to try to make some follow-up poke tasks today  #consider-poke-follow-up

@08:29 Been thinking a lot about the mechanics of this over the last few days #concept-concerto
Things involving Gesture mechanics. Specifically,
the concept of getting some kind of "auto-accompaniment"
to work with Gesture signal generator systems. Something
something event scheduler. Might be good to write some
things down.

@08:32 Writing better error handling for gendb

@09:01 Phew. Okay. Now, we can publish.

@09:10 TIC-80 investigations part 2. #investigate-tic80-audio
