# Tasks

Here is where I'll make tasks for myself. I'm not
sure what the format for this will be, but it might
possibly use my existing dagzet format? It will
be stored here as text.

## Tasks list

Tasks are broken up into different text files. Think
of it as like throwing things into a bin.

Here are a few that I've made so far:

`code_study.txt`: various codebases to look at

`done.txt`: Tasks that are completed.

`main.txt`: Tasks that don't have a distinct
category (yet).

`priority.txt`: a regularly curated list that keeps only
a few tasks in there. These should be the most urgent
tasks.

`reading.txt`: tasks related to reading.

`rust.txt`: general rust-related tasks that aren't
about reading.
