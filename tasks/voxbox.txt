@implement-gesture-path implement initial gesture path
In Gesture Synthesis, a path is a primitive construct
that builds up a single gesture from a list of values,
which are referred to as gesture vertices. A gesture vertice
has 3 components: a scalar value, a rate multiplier that
determines duration, and a behavior parameter that determines
how to interpolate to the next value.
