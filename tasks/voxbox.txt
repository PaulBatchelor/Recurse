@!desc tasks related to the voxbox project

@create-diams-interface create separate diameters interface
In other words, don't include the diameters array/vector
in the core tract struct since it is only partially used.

@demo-preset-export add preset export for initial demo

@demo-crossfade-shapes add shape crossfader support
It's very helpful to be able to program a base shape (such as
an "ah"), then crossfade to another

@demo-react-UI port demo to react UI
It's important to me that I do this because I want to
become familiar with some frontend technologies.

@voxbox-better-size-control Improve tract size/length control with interpolation

@demo-tongue-control "tongue control" demo
