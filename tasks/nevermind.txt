@!desc things I changed my mind about.

@poke-laughter-chitter implement laughter and chitter
Nevermind. This too much work to build properly. I need
a better sound prototyping environment.

@poke-evolving-sounds Add evolving sounds to poke
Nevermind. An initial attempt was made to this, but
it's going to take a great deal of work to get
those interactoins feeling good, and the webaudio
pipeline is too slow.

@demo-trio-low-timing Investigate low voice timing issues
Nevermind. It's still there, but the problem feels
negligible at this point.
