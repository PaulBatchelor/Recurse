@!desc things I changed my mind about.

@poke-laughter-chitter implement laughter and chitter
Nevermind. This too much work to build properly. I need
a better sound prototyping environment.

@poke-evolving-sounds Add evolving sounds to poke
Nevermind. An initial attempt was made to this, but
it's going to take a great deal of work to get
those interactoins feeling good, and the webaudio
pipeline is too slow.

@demo-trio-low-timing Investigate low voice timing issues
Nevermind. It's still there, but the problem feels
negligible at this point.

@investigate-c2rust Investigate c2rust
NEVERMIND. Couldn't get it to build, also there
are already XM player crates in Rust.
I want to see if I can get the XM file player
I like using working.

@investigate-xmrsplayer Investigate XMrsPlayer
NEVERMIND. this didn't end up sounding all
that good.

@voxsculpt-preset-manager create preset manager for voxsculpt
NEVERMIND. Ran out of time.

@test-dz-log-task-linking proof of concept: link dagzet node to task via log entry
NEVERMIND. Too much work, very little payoff.

@read-js-triva frontend guide: js trivia initial read
NEVERMIND. This wasn't a great resource.

@frontend-mentor Frontend Mentor
Nevermind.
