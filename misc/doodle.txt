@2024-09-22 Notes
@14:11 Tilt: something to do with Kubernetes
"Are your servers running locally? In Kubernetes? Both?
Tilt gives you smart rebuilds and live updates everywhere
so that you can make progress." [[https://tilt.dev/]].

@14:14 Flask backend, entry point: server/index.py

@14:17 flask_socketio, web socket stuff?
I actually don't really know much about websockets. Every
time I've heard about them, they've been used as a way to
shove data into a browser from an unusual source.
---
Looking up things on wikipedia.

@14:20 Going right to the RFC because I'm a grown-up. RFC 6455.
"The goal of this technology is to provide a mechanism for browser-based
applications that need two-way communication with servers that does
not rely on opening multiple HTTP connections (e.g., using
XMLHttpRequest or <iframe>s and long polling)."
---
In other words, this is probably a faster way to communicate
with a backend. So, if you're doing things like setting up
an editor that involves constantly sending many commands,
you'd probably want this.

@14:32 What is double star in python again?
When used to populate a dictionary, it kind of acts like
spread syntax. Got it. It's also seems to be used for
variadic functions (single-star: variadic args,
double-star: variadic named args)

@14:49 Client sockets done on frontend in typescript using socket.io
"Socket.IO is a library that enables low-latency, bidirectional
and event-based communication between a client and a server."
---
see: [[https://socket.io/docs/v4/]].
---
Looks like they cover a few different transport layer types,
not just websockets. They also do HTTP long-polling (is this the "old school"
way to do it?) and WebTransport (this seems "new school")
@14:51 Web transport is indeed very new.
See: [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebTransport_API]].
